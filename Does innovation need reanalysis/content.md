Syntactic reanalysis has been claimed to be the only mechanism capable of
explaining syntactic change. However, the concept of syntactic reanalysis is
flawed. It insufficiently accommodates gradience in synchronic grammar and
in language change, and depends too heavily on ambiguity as a cause of change.
Alternative mechanisms exist to account for innovation that do not suffer
from these problems. At the same time, the problem of explaining syntactic
innovations is partly tied to models of language that overstate the role of syntax.
Part of the problem therefore disappears under different theoretical starting
assumptions.

## Introduction

language change (p. 23)
- happens as a **side-effect** of language users' pursuit of other goals (Keller 1990; Joseph 1992;
Berg 1998; Haspelmath 1999; Fischer 2000; Croft 2000)
- a specific innovation is likely only to the extent that it can somehow **arise
from how language is routinely used**
- i.e. how
language is acquired, how it is mentally represented, how utterances are processed,
or how they are produced and interpreted ...

not one explanation (p. 23)
- **different models of language disagree on [how language changes]** and, as a result, predict different types of change
- => different kinds of diachronic explanations for phenomena

syntactic reanalysis (p. 24)
- the privileged mechanism to account for syntactic
change

$info$
The explanatory value [of syntactic reanalysis] has been called into question, however, both on
empirical and on theoretical grounds (Haspelmath 1998; Fischer 2007; De Smet
2009; Bybee 2010).

## Reanalysis

### Definition

precondition (p. 24)
- there exists such a thing as abstract syntactic representation

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

syntactic reanalysis (p. 25)
- a mechanism of change that **assigns a new underlying structure to a surface sequence** without overtly modifying that sequence

$reader$
**Langacker's definition**

I will define “reanalysis” as **a change in the structure of an expression or class
of expressions that does not involve any immediate or intrinsic modification
of its surface manifestation**. Reanalysis may lead to changes at the surface level
[...] but these surface changes can be viewed as the natural and expected result
of functionally prior modifications in rules and underlying representations.
(Langacker 1977, p. 58)
$/reader$

### Effects

surface changes? (p. 25)
- *can* result from reanalysis
- not immediate, but can result from the deeper structural changes
- => **actualisation**

$reader$
The reanalysis itself is covert until some recognizable modification in the forms
reveals it. (Hopper & Traugott 2003, p. 50)
$/reader$

### Properties

$acco$
**1.** abrupt (p. 26)
- reanalysis is abrupt (in a qualitative sense)
- there is a shift between
two representations that are radically distinct, with no in-between alternatives
- suddenly, the structure has changed

$info$
in contrast, actualization is commonly seen as gradual, in the sense
that it potentially involves multiple small surface changes that do not take place
simultaneously. (p. 26)
$/info$
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** ambiguity (p. 26-27)
- reanalysis takes place through ambiguity
- some surface
sequences allow two alternative analyses that the shift from one analysis to the
other can take place

$result why does it happen? (p. 27)
- language acquisition
- balance between transparency and code simplicity (Langacker 1977)
- avoidance of opaque grammars (Lightfoot 1979)
- the application of linguistic universals (Andersen 1973; Anttila 1989)

## Problems

### Abruptness

#### Grammaticalisation

----
$widec$
Key idea: a
surface form switches abruptly from one syntactic representation to another
$/widec$
----

grammaticalization (p. 28)
- implements structural change **gradually** rather than abruptly
- => this implies that
many purported cases of reanalysis (i.e. those involving grammaticalization) may
violate the abruptness associated with reanalysis

$example$
For word class changes, Haspelmath (1998) argues that transitions from
one word class to another tend to be stepwise, with an item assuming the formal
properties of its new word class one by one.3 His most elaborate example comes
from Kortmann & König’s (1992) study of prepositions developing out of verbs
in European languages. The study demonstrates that some of those prepositions
(such as English _during_ or _pending_) show many prepositional properties whereas
others (such as English _preceding_ or _facing_) show few.
$/example$

$widec$
If reanalysis is abrupt, then why is actualisation gradual? 
$/widec$
----

grammaticalisation is gradual (p. 30)
- e.g. ENG semi-modals: _gonna_, _gotta_, _hafta_, _wanna_
- assumed to be gradual

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

syntactic reanalysis (p. 30)
- gradual as well?

#### Frequency effects

frequency-driven decrease in compositionality (p. 30)
- give a likely explanation for certain structural changes (p. 33)
- => could apply to reanalysis as well!

$reader$
Repeated exposure to a particular phonological pattern (be it one we classically
call a morpheme, a word, or even a sequence of words) increases speed and
fluency of processing of the pattern. [...] As this process is repeated, any tendency
toward compositionality within the pattern is gradually reduced, leading to words
and word sequences losing their compositionality if they are of high absolute or
relative frequency. (Bybee & McClelland 2005, p. 396)

- there is no cut-off point at which want to ceases in the eyes of
the language user to consist of two separate elements and is fused into one (see
also Bybee 2004, 2006, 2010)
- evidence from grammaticalization primarily
demonstrates the relation between frequency and gradual formal fusion (Krug 2000)
-  That the loss of underlying compositionality is also a gradient phenomenon is mainly supported by research in other domains, notably morphology
(Hay & Baayen 2005)

(p. 30)
$/reader$

#### Hybrids

hybrids (p. 31)
- manifest **conflicting behavioural features**
- evidence that
some surface forms instantiate different underlying structures at the same time
- commonly found in **actualization processes**, indicating that
instances of a reanalyzed item **need not resort either under its old or its new
analysis**
- old and new analyses can simultaneously influence the
item’s behaviour (De Smet 2012a)

$info$
The idea that a form instantiates either one
structure or another is thereby contradicted. (p. 31)
$/info$

$example$
**A lot of**

1. original sense: head noun -> a set of articles to be sold in batch
2. new sense: a **quantifier** -> indicating a large amount of something

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

1. _a **lot** of goods is to be fitted out for auction_ (1853, COHA)
	- agreement with head noun -> singular
2. _a **lot** of parchments about the chair / Are handed to witnesses then and
there_ (1859, COHA)
	- agreement with head noun -> plural

(p. 31)
$/example$

$result hybrid form (p. 31)
- if *lot* is part of a quantifier, it should not combine with adjectives
- if *lot* is a noun, it should not relinquish its head status yet
- but: look in $see $down

$example$
3. _an awful **lot** of people are on medication who don’t need it._
(1993, COHA)
	-  behaves as a noun
in selecting a modifying adjective (_awful_) but as a quantifier in being transparent
to agreement

(p. 31)
$/example$

### Ambiguity

#### Ambiguity cannot exist by itself

problem with ambiguity (p. 33)
- a surface element can only be
ambiguous between two interpretations if those interpretations are **independently
supported** (Fischer 1988, 2007; De Smet 2009)

$example$
The form [soʊl] in (6) is ambiguous between the meanings ‘bottom of a shoe’ and ‘spiritual part of man’ because
both those meanings are separately attested for [soʊl] outside the context in (6).

6. _Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
[...] a mender of bad soles._ (Shakespeare, Julius Caesar 1.1.10–14)

- $result Supposing [soʊl] in English meant only ‘bottom of a shoe’, the pun in (6) would
not work, since the ambiguity with ‘spiritual part of man’ would simply never arise.
$/example$

$widec$
$down syntactic domain
$/widec$

$example$
- predicative adjective, for-NP and to-infinitive in (7a) is structurally ambiguous because **both of its readings are independently supported**

7. a. _But in general it was good for mankind to look outward to the
stars._ (BNC)  
	- ... it~i~ was [good for mankind] [to look outward to the stars]~i~.
	- ... it~i~ was [good] [for mankind to look outward to the stars]~i~.

  b. Which we believe is good for our customers. And good for our business.  
  
c. [a horse’s] sense of smell must function for it to assess horses it has not  
met before (BNC)

$wide$
- $result from contexts like
(7b–c) (and various others) it follows that the for-NP in (7a) could be the benefactive of good or the subject of the following to-infinitive. But without the contradictory evidence from (7b–c), (7a) would not be ambiguous at all
$/wide$
$/example$

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

chicken and egg solved (p. 34)
- a form can only be ambiguous if its conflicting interpretations already exist
- => ambiguity cannot be a source of innovation

$info$
More likely, it is _innovation_ that is a source of ambiguity. (p. 34)
$/info$

#### Syntactic theoretic explanations

$acco$
**1.** language acquisition reanalysis (p. 35)
- assumption: language users have access to syntactic structures beyond what is attested in their specific language
- child assigns structure to the utterances it is exposed to, homing in on
a possible grammar to match its parents’ linguistic output
	- but: may arrive at a grammar that differs from its parents’ albeit
with approximately the same output

$wide$
- $result only really applicable if there are only a few structures, which is not the case
$/wide$
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** ambiguity between attested structural possibilities (p. 35)
- only ambiguity between constructions that have been attested by the language user

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

categorical incursion (p. 35)
- one construction extends its range of application into the domain of (what used to be) another
- uses **analogical extension**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text { beep }}{\text { beeped }}&=\frac{\text { weep }}{\mathrm{x}} \\
\frac{\text { the book is brilliant }}{\text { a truly brilliant book }}&=\frac{\text { the book is rubbish }}{\mathrm{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$wide$
- $result does not seem to allow for genuine innovation (only mere "extension" of existing constructions)
$/wide$
$/acco$

$widec$
$down

no ambiguity can arise **unless both relevant interpretations are somehow _already_ licensed by the grammar** (p. 37)
$/widec$

## Innovation

### Innovation through analogy

analogy bad (p. 37)
- poor reputation as a source
of structural innovation
- can _at most_ account for items
switching categorial allegiance, but _not_ for the introduction of fundamentally
new categories

$result unjustified (p. 34)
- any analogically-licensed addition to an existing category _changes_ that category, to the point that **similarity-based generalizations can give rise to wholly new categories**
- => the piecemeal addition of new members to a category can **gradually work
substantial changes** (De Smet 2012b)

### Innovation through other mechanisms

----
$widec$
Other mechanisms of change 
can bring genuine innovation yet need not involve reanalysis!
$/widec$
----

$acco$
**1.** frequency (p. 40)
- can result in formal
and structural coalescence
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** blending (p. 41)
- the intertwining of parts of competing formulations (Coppock 2010, p. 38)

$example$
13. that’s torrible! (terrible/horrible) (quoted from garrett 1980, p. 179).
$/example$
$/acco$

### Structural indeterminacy

----
$widec$
Some apparent innovations are syntactically less innovative than they may seem. (p. 42)
$/widec$
----

$result syntactic innovation as a theoretical construct (p. 42)
- (cf. Haspelmath 1998)
- need for reanalysis to a degree stems from the
assumptions made by specific models of synchronic syntactic theory
	- assumptions are changed -> the apparent logical necessity of reanalysis disappears
- =>  changes may **_seem_ more
innovative than they actually** are simply because of the syntactic model used to describe them

## Conclusions

----
$widec$
Syntactic reanalysis is problematic (p. 43)
$/widec$
----

1. it downplays the gradualness of change and overestimates the
role of ambiguity
2. it conflates different underlying mechanisms of change
as well as different types of outcomes
3. syntactic reanalysis is not the only way to explain grammatical innovation in language change
4. syntactic reanalysis is at least in part tied to models
of grammar that are intolerant of syntactic indeterminacy

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

syntactic indeterminacy (p. 43)
- allows a new interpretation of various grammatical changes
- functionally innovative, but not necessarily _syntactically_ innovative.

questions (p. 44)
- $see $down

1. Should reanalysis be abandoned altogether?
	- It's useful: it
describes a recurrent constellation of change in which **functional specialization
can take place without immediate surface modification**
	- Even
so, the above also suggests that explanations for changes describable as reanalyses
may have to take recourse to **very different underlying mechanisms**, which may
ultimately challenge the usefulness of even a purely descriptive application of the
term.
2. The alternatives to reanalysis suggested here are **only operational to
the extent that** (among other things) the relative role of **similarity-based generalization** and **structural indeterminacy** in synchronic grammar is **clarified**
	- The question is only beginning to be explored of how
much similarity is needed for language users to spot a potential new generalization (Petré 2012)
3. The type of alternative explanations proposed here <span style="color: red;">**have hardly been
put to the test systematically**</span>
	- Their application to a much wider variety of documented changes is ultimately the only way to evaluate their validity and find any
shortcomings
