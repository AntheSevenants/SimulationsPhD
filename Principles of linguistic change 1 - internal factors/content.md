### Recent evidence for lexical diffusion

Wang (60s-70s)
- found very little evidence for exceptionless sound change in Chinese

$reader$
We hold that words change their pronunciations by discrete, perceptible
increments (i.e. phonetically abrupt), but **severally at a time** (i.e. **lexically gradual**)

cause for lexical diffusion
- split in Chinese data
- unable to be explained on phonetic terms

## Expanding the Neogrammarian Viewpoint

### The current status of the Neogrammarian position

Neogrammarian hypothesis 'misinterpreted'?
- is a sound law just what happens when *all* words have been affected after lexical diffusion?

### The Neogrammarian conclusion

$p=471$

$reader$
There is no basis for contending that lexical diffusion is somehow
more fundamental than regular, phonetically motivated sound change. On
the contrary, if we were to decide the issue by counting cases, **there appear
to be far more substantially documented cases of Neogrammarian sound
change than of lexical diffusion**. The upshot of this discussion is not, 
however, a victory for the Neogrammarians. **There are more than enough solid
examples of sounds changing one word at a time to support the view that
lexical diffusion is deeply rooted in the process of change**. But where it is
rooted, and where it flourishes, is more difficult to decide. We cannot
resolve a paradox by saying that both parties are right. Though we have
advanced evidence on both sides, the situation is no less chaotic than it
was at the outset. If language changes in two different ways, **the data must
contain some hint that will tell us when it changes in one way, and when
in the other**.

## The overestimation of functionalism

### Functionalism and functionalists

### Functional explanations of sound change

$p=603-604$

$reader$
Much of the discussion concerned synchronic variation; it was found that
the choice of one linguistic variant or another is not determined by the
need to preserve information, but is **influenced by the tendency to maintain
parallel structure and parallel articulation**. The chapters in this part 
considered how this syntagmatic principle might affect the course of change,
which is essentially paradigmatic, following the principle that functional
effects are primarily the consequences of linguistic choices rather than the
causes of them. 
$/reader$

$p=568$

### Conclusion

$reader$
Given
phonological and morphological variation, the functional hypothesis predicts 
a **tendency for speakers to choose one variant or the other in a fashion
that will preserve information**. Most of the results cited **show the opposite**:
in the stream of speech, one variant or the other is chosen **without regard
to the maximization of information**. On the contrary, the major effects that
determine such choices are mechanical: phonetic conditioning and simple
repetition of the preceding structure.

### Arguments from syntax

$reader$
**Labov (1983)**

This study concerns the choice between the passive (1) and the generalized active (2) in English.

Figure 20.3 shows that **the mechanical effects of priming and parallel structure were by far the most important**.


- The passive was favored most strongly if the **preceding instance** of the
variable was also a passive (.69 vs. .31).
- There was also a strong **tendency to maintain parallel structure**: that
is, coreferential subjects are maintained in the same syntactic position (.62 vs. .38).
- The third effect is one that might be considered functional, though it
does not involve the loss or retention of information. It involves the
**tendency for given information to be placed first**, and new information
to follow. There is a tendency to favor the passive if the subject of the
passive is given information (.56 vs. .44), that is, if it occurs somewhere
in the preceding four clauses.2

When an element of the system is found to cooccur frequently with the
signal being deleted, it is increasingly eligible to assume the distinctive
