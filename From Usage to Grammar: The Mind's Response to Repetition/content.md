## Usage-based grammar

separation
- the *use* of language <-> internalised structure of language
- ~= *langue* and *parole* (De Saussure)
- ~= *competence* and *performance* (Chomsky)

historically
- much emphasis on *competence*, not the actual use of language
- but also: functionalists (study language use) + cognitive linguists
	- joined under "usage-based" linguists

grammar from a usage-based POV
- language is the **cognitive organisation of one's experience with language**
- e.g. frequency of use -> conventionalisation
- grammar (cognitive representation) arises from a categorising experience from language *use*

## Converging trends in linguistic theory

methodological trends
- theoretical issues are now commonly addressed through **text corpora**

$widec$
(p. 3)
$/widec$

grammaticalisation
- played a central role in  emphasizing the point that both
grammatical meaning and grammatical form come into being through **repeated instances
of language use**
- => how grammar
is created **over time**, thus setting a higher goal for linguistic explanation

## Findings

conventionalised word sequences
- characterises both written and spoken discourse
- both formulaic language and idioms, but also conventionalised collocations

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

$acco$
idioms
- conventionalized word sequences
that usually contain ordinary words and predictable morpho-syntax
- but: have **extended
meaning** (usually of a metaphorical nature)
- acknowledged to need lexical
representation because of the unpredictable aspects of their meaning
	- but: not _completely_ isolated since **many aspects of their meaning
and form derive from more general constructions** and the meaning of the component
words in other contexts (nunberg et al. 1994)
- e.g. _pull strings_, _level
playing field_, _too many irons in the fire_

idioms provide evidence for organized storage in which
sequences of words can have lexical representation while still being associated with other
occurrences of the same words, as in this diagram from bybee 1998.
$/gallery port$
$/acco$

$acco$
prefabs
- word sequences that are **conventionalized, but predictable in all other ways**
- e.g. _prominent role_, _mixed message_, _beyond repair_, _to
need help_
- e.g. *finish up*, *burn down*, *interested in*, *think of*, *think about*

$info$
Erman and Warren 2000
found that what they call prefabricated word combinations constitute about 55% of both
spoken and written discourse. 
$/info$

$info$
Speakers recognize prefabs as familiar, which indicates
that these sequences of words must have memory storage despite being largely
predictable in form and meaning.
$/info$

$warn$
The line between idiom and prefab is not always clear since many prefabs require
a metaphorical stretch for their interpretation. The following may be intermediate
examples, where at least one of the words requires a more abstract interpretation: _break a
habit_, _change hands_, _take charge of_, _give (s.o.) plenty of time_, _drive (s.o.) crazy_. The
lack of a clear boundary between idioms and prefabs would also suggest that both types
of expression need memory storage.
$/warn$
$/acco$

grammar emergent from experience (Hopper, 1987)
- mutable, and ever coming into being rather than static, categorical, and fixed
- => language is a **complex dynamic system**
	- no structure a priori, but rather the apparent structure emerges from the
**repetition of many local events** (in this case speech events)

## Goals of the article

## Frequency effects on processing and storage

----
$widec$
Three effects of token frequency that have been established in "recent" literature
$/widec$
----

$acco$
**1.** reducing effect
- high frequency words and phrases undergo phonetic reduction at a faster
rate than low and mid frequency sequences
- applies to phrases of **extreme high frequency**
- e.g. *i don’t know*

$result explanation
- the articulatory representation of words and sequences of words are made up of neuromotor
routines
- when sequences of neuromotor routines are repeated, their execution becomes
more fluent
- => increased fluency is the result of representing the repeated sequence at
a higher level as a single unit
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** conserving effect
- relates to the **morphosyntactic structure of a string**
- high frequency sequences become more
entrenched in their morpho-syntactic structure and resist change on the basis of more
productive patterns
- **frequency strengthens the memory representations of words or phrases**
making them easier to access whole and thus less likely to be subject to analogical
reformation
	- applies to syntactic sequences as well
- e.g. English irregular verbs -> low frequency irregular verbs have a higher tendency to regularise
$/acco$

$widec$
(p. 6)
$/widec$

$acco$
**3.** autonomy effect
- morphologically complex forms (or strings of words) of high frequency can lose
their internal structure as they become autonomous from etymologically related forms
- e.g. words with derivational
affixes become less transparently related to their base forms as they become more
frequent
- e.g. the semantic opacity of words
such as _dislocate_

$info$
This effect also
applies in grammaticization when sequences that are originally complex (such as _be
going to_) lose their semantic and syntactic transparency and move away from other
instances of the words _be_, _go_, and _to_.
$/info$
$/acco$

[ Effects and their corresponding frequencies ]
|effect|frequency|
|---|---|
|reducing effect|high frequency items (linear relation)|
|conserving effect|high frequency items|
|autonomy effect|**extremely** high frequency items|

$info$
The impossibility at the moment of specifying ranges for extreme high,
medium and low is only a function of the state of our knowledge. As more empirical
studies appear, absolute frequency ranges for each phenomena will eventually be
specifiable.
$/info$

## Construction-based representations

representation based on constructions
- turns out to be highly effective!
- $see $down

$reader$
"Cognitive representations of grammar are organized into constructions which are
partially schematic, conventionalized sequences of morphemes with a direct
semantic representation" (Goldberg 2003).
$/reader$

$widec$
(p. 7)
$/widec$

constructions according to Goldberg
- $see $down

$acco$
$widec$
$down most lexically explicit
$/widec$

1. idioms with fixed lexical content: _go great guns_
2. idioms that are partially filled: _jog_ <someone’s> _memory_
3. constructions with some fixed material: _he made his way through the crowd_
4. fully abstract constructions: _they gave him an award_

$widec$
$down most schematic
$/widec$
$/acco$

$info$
Almost all constructions contain some explicit
morphological material, tying them fairly concretely to specific words or morphemes
(e.g. way and the possessive pronoun in 3). The ditransitive construction in 4 contains no
specific phonological material that identifies it as the ditransitive. Only the word order
signals this. However, it should be noted that only a small class of verbs can occur in this
construction so that it also has a grounding in lexical items.
$/info$

$result high use of prefabs and idioms in natural speech
- a good deal of production (and perception) refers to sequences of
pre-specified lexical choices rather than to abstract grammar
- => a model that builds a grammar from specific instances of language use (such as an exemplar model or a connectionist model) seems appropriate

## Exemplar representation

### What is exemplar theory?

exemplar theory
- every token of
experience is classified and placed in a vast organizational network as a part of the
decoding process
- this matching process
has an effect on the representations themselves -> new tokens of experience are not
decoded and then discarded, but rather **they impact memory representations**

$result impacting memory representations
- **token of linguistic experience is identical to an existing exemplar** -> mapped onto
that exemplar, strengthening it
- **token of linguistic experience is _similar_ (but not identical) to an existing exemplar** -> stored near similar exemplars to constitute clusters or categories as a *new* exemplar

$result ordering of exemplar clusters
- can be **hierarchical**
- set of exemplars that are
judged to be similar phonetically and represent the same meaning are clustered together
and are represented at a higher level as a word or phrase
- <span style="background-color: $colour;">**constructions** emerge when
phrases that bear some formal similarity as well as some semantic coherence are stored
close to one another</span>

### Applying exemplar theory to language

----
$widec$
Which factors help us understand how constructions came into being, and change over time?
$/widec$
----

1. Exemplar representations **allow specific information about instances of use to
be retained in representation**
2. Exemplar representation **provides a natural way to allow frequency of use to
determine the strength of exemplars**
3. Exemplar clusters are categories that **exhibit prototype effects**. They have
members that are **more or less central to the category**, rather than categorical
features

$widec$
$down how to apply to language?
$/widec$

$acco$
**1.** probabilistic grammar representation
- based on the experience of the language user

|specific storage|distributed storage|
|---|---|
|storing the relatively low frequency phrase such as _beige curtains_ as a unit|mapping the two words onto existing exemplars of these words|

$info$
Only when a sequence is repeated will access to it as a unit rather than by
its parts become more efficient.
$/info$
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** human memory capacity is "quite large"
- an important feature of linguistic
experience is the regular repetition of phonological strings, words, and constructions
- repeated experience causes you to notice details
- memory decays, despite repeated experience
$/acco$

$widec$
(p. 9)
$/widec$

$acco$
**3.** reorganisation is possible
- linguistic memories represented as exemplars can undergo
considerable reorganization, particularly when change is ongoing in a language
$/acco$

## Exemplar representation of constructions

grouping
- exemplars of words or phrases that are similar on different
dimensions are **grouped together** in cognitive storage
- => constructions can emerge from this

origin of constructions
- an exemplar representation of a partially filled
construction would have experienced tokens mapping onto the constant parts of the
construction exactly, strengthening these parts
	- the open slots would not match exactly
- if there are **similarities** (in particular _semantic_ similarities) among the items
occurring in the open slot, a **category** for these items would begin to develop

$example$
**Spanish *quedarse* + adjective 'become ADJ'**

$$
\text { quedarse } \quad\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\underline{\text { tranquilo }} & \text { 'tranquil' } \\
\text { quieto } & \text { 'quiet, still' } \\
\text { inmóvil } & \text { 'still, immobile }
\end{array}\right\}
$$
$/example$

$/widec$

## Effects of repetition on particular instances of constructions

----
$widec$
Various degrees of effect, depending upon the extent of frequency
$/widec$
----

1. low levels of repetition lead to **conventionalization only** (as in prefabs and idioms)
2. higher levels of repetition can lead to the establishment of a **new construction
with its own categories**
3. extreme high frequency leads to the **grammaticization of the new construction** and
the creation of grammatical morphemes and changes in constituency

## Grammaticalisation

grammaticalisation
- the creation of a new
grammatical morpheme and a new construction out of a particular instance of an old
construction
-  an existing construction with specific lexical items in it becomes more
frequent, changes in various ways, and becomes a new construction

$example$
***be going to***

- late 16th century:  an exemplar of a general
purpose construction sometimes used in the progressive

6. Don Alphonso,  
With other gentlemen of good esteem,  
Are journeying to salute the emperor  
And to commend their service to his will. (Two Gentlemen of Verona I.3)
7.  I was sending to use Lord Timon myself… (Timons of Athens II.2)

### Case study: the effects of frequency on *going to*

**1.** reducing effect
- *going to* is often phonologically reduced to *gonna*
- happens when words and phrases are often repeated
- *going to* is processed as a single unit -> neuromotor routine gets simplified

**2.** autonomy effect
- lost association with other instances of the verb *go*
- "going to" now leads its own life, so to speak

$widec$
(p. 12)
$/widec$

**3.** loss of specific meaning
- no longer: specific movement in space
- in many contexts originally carried the pragmatic inference of intention
- repeated instances of the construction in this pragmatic context give rise to the new construction

**4.** reanalysis
- solidification as a single unit
- frequently used together, so becomes to be processed together as a unit
- *going to* becomes one unit, both phonologically and syntactically

## New constructions without grammaticalisation

----
$widec$
Argument: particular instances of constructions that have been
experienced by a speaker must be present in cognitive representation
$/widec$
----

idioms with specific metaphorical meaning
- must have **cognitive representation**, even though they are still related to the lexemes and construction from which they arose

prefabs
- conventionalized but more transparent in meaning than $see $up
- must _also_ have a representation (because they are conventional) but that representation is **associated with
the representations for their component parts**

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

focus here
- the creation of constructions that **carry specific pragmatic implications**
- but: still maintain at least a **surface resemblance to the construction from which they arose**

$widec$
(p. 13)
$/widec$

$example$
- Diner: Waiter, **what’s this fly doing in my soup?**
- Waiter: Why, madam, I believe that’s the backstroke.
(From Fillmore and Kay 1994)

The joke shows the **possible ambiguity of the highlighted sequence**. As Fillmore
and Kay point out, the usual interpretation of ‘what is X doing Y’ is one of surprise at
incongruity accompanied by more than a hint of disapproval. Because it is syntactically
indistinct from the construction from which it arose, it gives the clever waiter license to
interpret it as a literal question about what the fly is doing.

The implication of disapproval (a subjective interpretation) **must have come from
multiple instances of use with this negative nuance**.
$/example$

$reader wide$
In order to know that a certain implication
has occurred frequently and is associated with a certain string of words, speakers must
register the context and the implications from the very first exposure. They could not wait
until they had heard the expression frequently in a certain context to register this in
memory, because if they did not remember each time, they would not know that they had
heard it before. Thus it seems clear that in order for this construction to acquire its special
meaning, the learner/hearer must record in memory the implication of incongruity and
disapproval from the very first exposure. Because this construction was earlier just a
special instance of a more general construction, the changes it has undergone indicate that
particular instances of constructions are registered in linguistic memory indexed with
their implications and contexts of use.

## Special phonological reduction

special phonology through frequency of use
- e.g. *I don't know*, *I don't think*
- phonological reduction in excess of that which could be attributed to online reduction processes
- => reduction has accumulated in representation

high frequency words and phrases
-  have larger
exemplar clusters and greater ranges of variation than low frequency words and phrases

$info$
As phonological reduction occurs on line, high frequency words and phrases have more
opportunity to undergo reduction. When an already reduced exemplar is selected for
production, it may undergo further reduction, leading to more advanced reduction in high
frequency phrases .
$/info$

## Exemplar representation of the linguistic sign

$reader wide$
We know that specific phonetic representations are associated in representation
with specific meanings and contexts because **in grammaticization phonological reduction
only occurs in the grammaticizing construction**. Thus the form _gonna_ is associated with
the intention/future meaning and not with the movement in space or purpose meaning.

## Frequency effects: category formation

### Nature of the category formed by the lexical items that are used in the open slot in constructions

what can go in the slot of a construction?
- sometimes: highly generalized -> takes all nouns or all verbs of the language
- other times: semantically constrained -> only specific nouns of verbs are allowed

$reader$
Bybee and Eddington found evidence that **high
frequency lexical instances of constructions can act as the central members of the
category formed by members of the open slot in a construction**.
$/reader$

$widec$
(p. 19)
$/widec$

$reader$
 These adjectives
form a category with proto-type effects: **the most frequent member is central and the
other members are more marginal**. Other members included adjectives that are basically
synonymous with inmóvil such as parado ‘stopped, standing’; adjectives that are
figurative/metaphorical de piedra ‘of stone’; and adjectives that share the ‘motionless’
feature but add other features, such as atrapado ‘trapped. Thus we argue for a category
with the high frequency member as the center of the category.

Rather than attempting to find abstract semantic features that characterize all the
adjectives used with a particular verb, **Bybee and Eddington propose that the verbs
quedarse and ponerse each have a number of such clusters of adjectives**. For instance,
central members of categories for quedarse besides the two mentioned above are the
following, which are related to quedarse inmóvil-- quedarse quieto ‘to become still’,
quedarse tranquilo ‘to calm down’, quedarse callado ‘to quiet down, become silent’,
quedarse dormido ‘to fall asleep’ and two other categories that are unrelated, quedarse
sorprendido ‘to be surprised’ and quedarse embarazada ‘to get pregnant’. See Bybee and
Eddington for further details.
$/reader$

### Evidence hat the most frequent member is central to the category

1. the larger, more productive categories (that is, those with the highest type
frequency) are organized around a frequent member, suggesting that productive uses of
the verb occur on the basis of reference to semantic similarity to a frequent member
	- The
groups of adjectives that occurred with the verbs that were less productive did not have a
high frequency member.
	- Of the four verbs studied, only two, quedarse and ponerse,
showed categories organized around high frequency exemplars. The other two verbs,
which are much less frequent with animate subjects, had a much more scattered and
miscellaneous distribution with adjectives.
2. Family resemblance structure uses the most frequent adjective as central.
3. We conducted an experiment on the acceptability of verb + adjective
combinations. We asked 48 peninsular Spanish speakers to rate the acceptability of
sentences we took from the corpus. All stimuli were all naturally-occurring utterances of
Spanish. The subjects were asked to rate the stimuli on a 5 point scale from
‘perfectamente bien’ ‘perfectly fine’ to ‘raro’ or ‘strange/rare’.

$widec$
(p. 20)
$/widec$

three groups of stimuli
- $see $down

1. High frequency phrases (_quedarse inmóvil_)
2. Low frequency phrases with a close semantic affinity to a high frequency phrase
(_quedarse parado_)
3. Low frequency phrases with no semantic connection to a high frequency phrase
(_quedarse orgullosísimo_ ‘become very proud’)

1. The high frequency phrases were judged most acceptable. (X^2^ (1) = 51.4, p <
.0001)
2. A significant difference was found between the high frequency phrases and the
low frequency phrases that were semantically similar to the high frequency
phrases. (For quedarse and ponerse together: X^2^ (1) = 6.22, p < .013.)
3. The strongest result was the significant difference between the low frequency
related items and the low frequency unrelated items. (X^2^ (1) = 32.9, p < 0.0001)

$wide$
- $result both **frequency** and **semantic similarity** to a frequent exemplar significantly
influenced the subjects’ judgments of acceptability
- $result not only do
speakers record specific exemplars of constructions in memory, but that **frequency of use
also has an impact on the strength of these exemplars and on category formation**
$/wide$

$widec$
(p. 21)
$/widec$

## Frequency effects: resistance to change

morpho-syntactic constructions
- resistant to change if they are highly frequent
- constructions with odd or irregular properties resist
change in the particular exemplars that are of high frequency

$example$
**The use of not-negation and no-negation (also called neg-incorporation) as in the examples such as the following: (Tottie 1991)**

22. He did _not_ see anything. (**not**-negation)
23. He saw _nothing_. (**no**-negation)

$reader wide$
Diachronically, the no-negation construction predates the construction with not
and the more recently developed construction with not is more productive, gradually
increasing its usage. Thus we can predict that the no-negation construction would be
maintained primarily in high frequency constructions and collocations, while notnegation would be spreading to more contexts.
$/reader wide$
$/example$

$reader wide$
Tottie studied these two constructions in a large corpus of spoken and written
British English. She extracted only those examples where the use of the alternate
construction would have the same meaning and implications (as in 22 and 23). She found
that certain constructions, especially existential _be_ (as in example 24), stative _have_ (as in
25) and copular _be_ (as in 26) have a higher use of _no_-negation than lexical verbs do, as
shown in Table 2. This suggests that _no_-negation, rather than being an option for all
sentences, has become associated with certain constructions.

| |Spoken||Written||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|existential _be_|34/38|89%|96/98|98%|
|stative _have_|18/28|64%|41/42|98%|
|copular _be_|12/20|60%|26/47|55%|
|lexical verbs|20/76|26%|67/104|64%|

These three constructions are fairly frequent, accounting together for more of the
data than all the lexical verbs combined. **Their frequency could help explain the fact that
they preserve the older construction**; much like the old ablauting verbs of English (_break_,
_broke_; _write_, _wrote_; etc.) their high frequency strengthens their representations and makes
them less likely to be reformed on the more productive pattern. This suggests that a
frequency effect might also be found among the lexical verbs. In fact, certain frequent verbs, i.e. know, do, give, make account for many of the
examples of no-negation in the lexical examples.

## Conclusion

1. Speakers are familiar with certain word combinations (prefabs) which are in no
way exceptional in meaning or form.
2. Special phonological reduction accrues to specific high frequency phrases.
3. New constructions are created out of specific instances of old general
constructions.
4. In grammaticization, changes in phonology, semantics, and structure occur in
extremely high frequency constructions.
5. Certain higher frequency exemplars of constructions dominate formation of
categories of items within constructions.
6. High frequency exemplars of constructions resist change on the basis of more
productive constructions
