### Introduction

topic at hand
- *why* the S-curve?

$p=55$

How change occurs
$/widec$
----

$acco$
$wide$
**1.** slow change
$/wide$

$reader$
After the first
occurrence, the curve slowly climbs through single-figure percentages until the
innovation is being used on maybe 20–25 per cent of the available occasions.
$/reader$
$/acco$

$acco$
$wide$
**2.** speed-up
$/wide$

$reader$
All the
time its rate of increase is increasing – the curve is getting steeper – and after
a while its progress is very rapid!

$acco$
**3.** final increase (theoretically)
-  rate goes on increasing until the remaining pool of unchanged words is altogether used up

diffusion is possible like this, but it doesn't work in this way

$acco$
**4.** final increase (realistically)
- after the phase when the new form gains ascendancy rather rapidly, the process of change slows down again as **the last remnants of the older state linger on**

$reader$
The whole thing can last hundreds of years altogether, indeed may never be
wholly completed, but **the bulk of the change is located within a much narrower
slice of time where the slope is steeper**. 
$/reader$

$p=57$

$example$
Examples of the passive progressive, which was first prevalent in its old form (*a road was building*), then suddenly received a new form (*a road was being built*). The new form became popular quickly, but the old form continued to exist for a while, though sporadically.
$/example$

$p=58$

### Why an S-shaped curve?

#### Stages of the S-curve

$acco$
**1.** ==innovation==
- change requires **variation** -> the existence of an alternative way of saying (roughly) the same thing

$info$
There must be *some* sort of advantage for using the new form (be it structural or social).
$/info$

$info$
At the same time, inertia and the need to communicate with older generations mean that
the old form has a reason to continue to exist.
$/info$
$/acco$

$acco$
**2.** ==propagation==
- "the change proper gets going if the new form acquires a **social value** (Croft 2000: 185–6)"

$reader$
**Speakers reproduce approximately what they hear, including variation,
and even apparently <span style="color: red;">including the rough proportions of variant usage they hear
around them</span>.**~3~ However, if there is some slight **advantage** in the new form over
the old, the <span style="color: red;">**proportions may adjust slightly**</span> in favour of the new.

~3~ Labov talks of **probability matching** (1994: 580–6, also cf. 1994: 65–6, 595), an interesting
concept which I cannot go into here.

form advantage
- shakes up the *status quo* -> frequencies not reproduced perfectly
- speaker has made a slightly different choice

$reader$
**Explaining the shape**

[The] effect of choice is greatest
when the two variants are both there to choose from. In the very early stages of
a change, so the argument runs, the new form is rare, so the pressures of choice
are relatively weak and the rate of change is slow. In the late stages of a change,
the old form is rare, so that the selective effect of having two forms to compare
and choose between is again weak, and once again the rate of change is slow.
Only in the middle period, when there are substantial numbers of each form in
competition, does the rate of change speed up. Hence the S-curve.

#### Mathematics

logistic function
- best mathematical model for modelling an S-curve

$p=59$

### The axes of the graph

#### Y-axis

$acco$
traditional
- => percentage of all speech events in a language during a period (theoretically)
- => percentages or relevant linguistic contexts in a corpus
$/acco$

$acco$
lexical diffusion
- changes spread word by word through the relevant lexemes of a language
- => proportion of relevant words which have succumbed to a change at a given time

$info$
Words that are particularly
salient, or maybe especially frequent or infrequent, or of a particular form,
might resist the change for reasons which had not applied – or at least did not
apply so strongly – to those words which had succumbed early on. 
$/info$
$/acco$

$acco$
syntactic change
- change through particular construction types
- (difficult to graph, since constructions are, by definition, infinite)
$/acco$

$p=61$

$acco$
orderly heterogeneity
- a strict free variation in the same speaker
$/acco$

$p=62$

$acco$
social network diffusion
- Milroy & Milroy diffusion via weak and strong ties
- percentage shows percentage of community using a particular form
$/acco$

#### X-axis

----
$widec$
What to plot on the horizontal scale?
$/widec$
----

$acco$
**1.** time of composition
- you plot it when it is uttered / written

**2.** time of birth of the writer
- you plot when the author was born

$/acco$

$wide$
- $result depends on viewpoint: does language change during adulthood of speakers?
$/wide$

### Syntactic illustrations

$p=65$

### Variables and variants

**1.** sound changes and S-curves
- phonological level: possibility of continuous variation -> no *two* competitors!
- can be solved using feature analysis to a quantised, abstract interpretation

**2.** more than two choices
- at any time, there are probably more than two competing forms

$p=66$

**3.** completely new form
- if a completely new form arises, there is no competition with anything

$p=67$

### Conflation of S-curves: the shape of English

$p=68$

### Concluding remark

$reader$
The S-curve
is neither as simple nor as uniform a phenomenon as is sometimes assumed.
Given too the simplistic picture of variation it sometimes reflects (and requires),
the S-curve should not be seized on too readily as _the_ general shape of language
change.
