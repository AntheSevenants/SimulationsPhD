**Summary**

Ellis discusses the
interrelation of frequency and cognition – in cognition in general as well
as in (second) language cognition – and, most importantly given current
discussions in usage-based approaches to language, provides a detailed
account of the factors that drive the kind of associative learning assumed
by many in the field: type and token frequency, Zipfian distributions as
well as recency, salience, perception, redundancy etc. Just as importantly,
Ellis derives a variety of conclusions or implications of these factors for
our modeling of learning and acquisition processes, which sets the stage
for the papers in this volume.

**Summary**

Raymond & Brown explore a range of frequency-related factors and
their impact on initial fricative reduction in Spanish. They begin by 
pointing out that results of previous studies have been inconclusive, in part
because many different studies have included only partially overlapping
predictors and controls; in addition, the exact causal nature of frequency
effects has also proven elusive. They then study data on [s]-initial Spanish
words from the free conversations from the New Mexico-Colorado Spanish
Survey, a database of interviews and free conversations initiated in 1991.
A large number of different frequency-related variables is coded for each
instance of an _s_-word, including word frequency, bigram frequency, 
transitional probability (in both directions), and others, and these are entered into
a binary logistic regression to try to predict fricative reduction.

The results show that s-reduction is influenced by many predictors, too
many to discuss here in detail. However, one very interesting conclusion is
that, once a variety of contextual frequency measures is taken into consideration, 
then non-contextual measures did not contribute much to
the regression model anymore, which is interesting since it forces us to
re-evaluate our stance on frequency, from a pure repetition-based view
to a more contextually-informed one, which in itself would constitute a
huge conceptual development (cf. also below).

## What statistics do learners track? Rules, constraints and schemas in (artificial) grammar learning

**Summary**

Kapatsinski’s study involves a comparison of product-oriented vs.
source-oriented generalizations by means of an artificial-language learning
experiment. Native speakers of English are exposed to small artificial languages 
that feature a palatalization process but differ in terms of whether
the sound favoring palatalization is also found attaching to the sound that
would be the result of the palatalization. The exposition to the artificial
languages (with small interactive video-clips) favors either a source-oriented 
generalization or a product-oriented generalization. The results
as obtained from cluster analyses of rating and production probabilities
provide strong support for product-oriented generalizations (esp. when
sources and products are not close to each other).

## Frequency, conservative gender systems and the language-learning child: Changing systems of pronominal reference in Dutch

**Summary**

De Vogelaer studies the gender systems of Dutch dialects. More specifically, 
he starts out from the fact that Standard Dutch exhibits a gender
mismatch of the binary article system and the ternary pronominal system
and explores to what degree this historical change is affected by frequency
effects. Results from a questionnaire study, in which subjects were put in
a position to decide on the gender of nouns, indicate high- and lowfrequency items 
behave differently: the former are affected in particular
by standardization whereas the latter are influenced more by resemanticization.
However, the study also cautions us that different types of data
can yield very different results with regard to the effect of frequency. De
Vogelaer compares frequency data from the 9-million-word Spoken Dutch
Corpus to age-of-acquisition data from a target vocabulary list. Correlation 
coefficients indicate that the process of standardization is more correlated with 
the adult spoken corpus frequencies whereas resemanticization
is more correlated with the age-of-acquisition data. As De Vogelaer puts
it, ‘‘frequency effects are typically poly-interpretable,’’ and he rightly advises
readers to regularly explore different frequency measures and register-specific frequencies.
