**Summary**

Ellis discusses the
interrelation of frequency and cognition – in cognition in general as well
as in (second) language cognition – and, most importantly given current
discussions in usage-based approaches to language, provides a detailed
account of the factors that drive the kind of associative learning assumed
by many in the field: type and token frequency, Zipfian distributions as
well as recency, salience, perception, redundancy etc. Just as importantly,
Ellis derives a variety of conclusions or implications of these factors for
our modeling of learning and acquisition processes, which sets the stage
for the papers in this volume.

### Frequency and cognition

#### Cognition

three major experiential factors that affect cognition
- frequency
- recency
- context

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

$reader$
1. The **more times** we experience something, the **stronger** our memory for it,
and the more fluently it is accessed.
2. The **more recently** we have experienced 
something, the **stronger our memory** for it, and the more fluently it
is accessed. (Hence your more fluent reading of the prior sentence than the
one before).
3. The **more times** we experience **conjunctions of features**, the
more they become **associated** in our minds and the more these subsequently 
affect perception and categorization; so a stimulus becomes
associated to a context and we become more likely to perceive it in that
context. 
$/reader$

$p=7-8$

percept
- a complex state of consciousness in which antecedent sensation is supplemented by consequent ideas which are
closely combined to it by association

$p=8$

#### Categorisation

categorisation
- testament to human 'tallying' (Ellis 2002)

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

fuzzy natural categories
- e.g. Wittgenstein (1953) -> organised through **family resemblances**

$reader$
[S]on may be like mother, and mother like sister, but in a very different
way. And we learn about these families, like our own, from experience.
Exemplars are similar if they have **many features in common** and **few 
distinctive attributes** (features belonging to one but not the other); the more
similar are two objects on these quantitative grounds, the faster are people
at judging them to be similar (Tversky 1977).
$/reader$

prototypes
- exemplars which are most typical of a category
- similar to many members of the category, but not similar to members of other categories
- (Rosch & Mervis 1975, Rosch et al. 1976)

$reader$
Prototypes are judged **faster** and **more accurately**, even if they
themselves have never been seen before [...] Such effects make 
it very clear that although people don’t go
around consciously counting features, they nevertheless have very accurate
knowledge of the **underlying frequency distributions** and their **central
tendencies**.

### Frequency and language cognition

#### Why frequency is important

$widec$
Language processing is very sensitive to usage frequency

- lexis
- morphosyntax
- formulaic language
- language comprehension
- grammaticality
- sentence production
- syntax

$reader$
Language knowledge involves **statistical knowledge**, so humans learn more easily and
process more fluently **high frequency forms** and ‘regular’ patterns which
are exemplified by many types and which have few competitors. 
$/reader$

language learning according to psycholinguists
- implicit associative learning of representations that reflect the probabilities of occurrence of form-function mappings

the rules of language
- structural regularities
- emerge from analysis of distributional characteristics of language inplut
- ~= what AI models are doing nowadays

#### Theoretical framework

usage-based linguistics
- a theoretical model
- 'we learn linguistic constructions while engaging in communication'

constructions
- form-meaning mappings
- conventionalised in the speech community
- entrenched as language knowledge in the learner's mind

$p=10$

$reader$
Goldberg’s
(2006) Construction Grammar argues that all grammatical phenomena
can be understood as learned pairings of form (from morphemes, words,
idioms, to partially lexically filled and fully general phrasal patterns) and
their associated semantic or discourse functions: ‘‘the network of constructions 
captures our grammatical knowledge _in toto_, i.e. It’s constructions
all the way down’’

$/wide$

$result sensitivity to input frequencies
- shows that language users actually register these frequencies
- => evidence for usage-based models of language acquisition (and processing)

$p=12$

##### Type and token frequency

|token frequency|type frequency|
|---|---|
|how often a particular form appears in the input|the number of distinct lexical items that can be substituted in a given slot in a construction\*|

$widec$
\* can be both a word-level construction for inflection or a syntactic construction
$/widec$

###### Type frequency

type
- licenses the productivity of phonological, morphological and syntactic patterns
- why? $see $down

$reader$
1. the more lexical items that are heard in a certain position in a construction, the less
likely it is that the construction is associated with a particular lexical item
and the more likely it is that a **general category** is formed over the items
that occur in that position;
1. the more items the category must cover, the
more general are its criterial features and the more likely it is to **extend** to
new items; 
1. high type frequency ensures that a construction is used
**frequently**, thus strengthening its representational schema and making it
more accessible for further use with new items
$/reader$

$info$
(so, in conclusion, it's just cognitively advantageous, and thus easy to defend this position)
$/info$

###### Token frequency

token
- promotes entrenchment / conservation of **irregular forms** and **idioms**

$info$
Irregular forms only survive because they are high frequency.
$/info$

$p=13$

##### Zipfian distribution

Zipf's law (1949)
- "in human language, the frequency of words decreases as a power function of their rank in the frequency table"
- many language events (e.g., frequencies of phoneme and letter strings, of words, of grammatical constructs, of formulaic phrases, etc.) across
scales of analysis follow this law (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole´ 2001, 2003)

learning categories from exemplars
- acquisition is optimized by the introduction of an **initial, low-variance sample** centered upon prototypical exemplars (Elio and Anderson 1981, 1984)
- allows learners to get a fix on what will account for most of the category members

$p=14$

##### Recency

recency effects / priming
- observed in phonology, conceptual representations, lexical choice and syntax (Pickering and Ferreira 2008)

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

syntactic priming
- the phenomenon of using a particular syntactic structure given
prior exposure to the same structure

$info$
This behavior has been observed when speakers hear, speak, read or write sentences (Bock 1986; Pickering 2006; Pickering and Garrod 2006).
$/info$

$p=15$

#### Form (salience and perception)

salience
- general perceived strength of stimuli

$result low salience cues
- tend to be less easily learnt

$reader$
Many grammatical meaning-form relationships, particularly those that
are notoriously difficult for second language learners like grammatical
particles and inflections such as the third person singular -s of English,
are of low salience in the language stream. For example, some forms are
more salient: ‘**_today_**’ is a stronger psychophysical form in the input than
is the **morpheme ‘-_s_’** marking 3rd person singular present tense, thus
while both provide cues to present time, **_today_ is much more likely to be
perceived**, and -_s_ can thus become overshadowed and blocked, making it
difficult for second language learners of English to acquire (Ellis 2006,
2008; Goldschneider and DeKeyser 2001).
$/reader$

#### Function

##### Prototypicality of meaning

central category members
- some members of categories are more typical of the category than others -> show the family resemblance more clearly

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

prototype
- the 'best' example of the category
- summarises the most representative attributes of category

$p=16$

$result token frequency
- very important contributor to the centrality of the prototype

##### Redundancy

redundant cues
- tend not to be acquired
- also found in the ==Rescorla-Wagner model== (1972)

$reader$
Not only are many grammatical meaning-form
relationships low in salience, but they can also be redundant in the 
understanding of the meaning of an utterance. For example, it is often 
unnecessary to interpret inflections marking grammatical meanings such as tense
because they are usually accompanied by adverbs that indicate the 
temporal reference. Second language learners’ reliance upon adverbial over
inflectional cues to tense has been extensively documented [...]
$/reader$

#### Interactions between these (contingency of form-function mapping)

contingency of mapping (Shanks 1995)
- important

$p=16-17$

$reader$
Consider how, in the learning of the category of birds,
while eyes and wings are equally frequently experienced features in the
exemplars, it is wings which are distinctive in di¤erentiating birds from
other animals. Wings are important features to learning the category of
birds because they are reliably associated with class membership, eyes are
neither. Raw frequency of occurrence is less important than the contingency 
between cue and interpretation.

$p=17$

#### The many aspects of frequency and their research consequences

$p=18$

$reader$
[W]hat we really want is a model of usage and its
effects upon acquisition. We can measure these factors individually. But
such counts are vague indicators of how the demands of human interaction 
affect the content and ongoing co-adaptation of discourse, how this
is perceived and interpreted, how usage episodes are assimilated into the
learner’s system, and how the system reacts accordingly. We need theoretical 
models of learning, development, and emergence that takes these
factors into account dynamically.

### Emergentism and complexity

- general framework
- quantitative, multivariate, multi-agent

#### Agents

agents everywhere
- "from neuron, through self, to society"
- => language emergence as a function of interactions within and between them

$reader$
[M]ore recently, work
within Emergentism, Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), and Dynamic
Systems Theory (DST) has started to describe a number of scale-free,
domain-general processes which characterize the emergence of pattern across

$widec$
Language considered as a CAS of dynamic usage and its experience

$/widec$
----

$wide$
- The system consists of **multiple agents** (the speakers in the speech community) interacting with one another.
- The system is **adaptive**, that is, speakers’ behavior is based on their
**past interactions**, and **current and past interactions** together **feed forward**
into future behavior.
- A speaker’s **behavior** is the **consequence of competing factors** ranging
from perceptual mechanics to social motivations.

It has become a hallmark of Complex Systems theory
where so-called fat-tailed distributions characterize phenomena at the edge
of chaos, at a self-organized criticality phase-transition point midway

Language usage,
social roles, language learning, and conscious experience are all socially
situated, negotiated, sca¤olded, and guided. They emerge in the dynamic
play of social intercourse. All these factors conspire dynamically in the
acquisition and use of any linguistic construction. **The future lies in trying
to understand the component dynamic interactions at _all_ levels**, and the
consequent emergence of the complex adaptive system of language itself.

## Are effects of word frequency effects of context of use?

William D. Raymond and Esther L. Brown

$p=2$

$reader$
**Summary**

Raymond & Brown explore a range of frequency-related factors and
their impact on initial fricative reduction in Spanish. They begin by 
pointing out that results of previous studies have been inconclusive, in part
because many different studies have included only partially overlapping
predictors and controls; in addition, the exact causal nature of frequency
effects has also proven elusive. They then study data on [s]-initial Spanish
words from the free conversations from the New Mexico-Colorado Spanish
Survey, a database of interviews and free conversations initiated in 1991.
A large number of different frequency-related variables is coded for each
instance of an _s_-word, including word frequency, bigram frequency, 
transitional probability (in both directions), and others, and these are entered into
a binary logistic regression to try to predict fricative reduction.

The results show that s-reduction is influenced by many predictors, too
many to discuss here in detail. However, one very interesting conclusion is
that, once a variety of contextual frequency measures is taken into consideration, 
then non-contextual measures did not contribute much to
the regression model anymore, which is interesting since it forces us to
re-evaluate our stance on frequency, from a pure repetition-based view
to a more contextually-informed one, which in itself would constitute a
huge conceptual development (cf. also below).

### Introduction

#### The link between word frequency and reduction

word frequency
- the relative **cumulative experience** that speakers have with words

$p=36$

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

word frequency and *reduction*
- widely studied -> word frequency impacts both **diachronic change** and **synchronic production variation**

$reader$
Investigations of the processes of _**sound
change**_ in language going back over a century 
have noted that more **frequent words are shorter** and 
**change more quickly** than less frequent words
(Schuchart 1885; Zipf 1929).
$/reader$

$reader$
In studies of _**synchronic pronunciation variation**_, 
evidence has been offered that **higher word frequency** is associated
with **more word reduction** in speech production, as measured by both
categorical measures of segment reduction or deletion (Bybee 2001, 2002;
Krug 1998; Jurafsky et al. 2001; Raymond, Dautricourt, and Hume 2006)
and also continuous measures of reduction, including durational shortening 
(Gahl 2008; Jurafsky et al. 2001; Pluymaekers, Ernestus, and Baayen
2005) and some acoustic parameters (Ernestus et al. 2006; Myers and Li
2007).

how does frequency of word use contribute to the reductive process?
$/widec$

#### Footnotes on the relation between frequency and reduction

other factors
- lexical structure and class
- extra-lexical phonological context
- prosodic environment
- speech rate
- sociolinguistic factors
- probabilistic variables
- but: usually frequency is predictive at *some* level

$reader$
[H]owever,
frequency effects are not ubiquitous.

- For example, Pluymaekers et al.
(2005) found that word frequency affected reduction of affix form and
duration for most but not all of the morphologically complex Dutch
words they studied.
- Similarly, some of the high-frequency function words
examined by Jurafsky et al. (2001) had low rates of reduction, despite their
high frequency and a control for phonological context. 
- Finally, Cohn et al.
(2005) found no effect of word frequency on durational shortening of homophones, although Gahl (2008) did.
$/reader$

$p=37$

$acco$
**2.** likelihood
- the likelihood that a word occurs in discourse contexts in a phonological environment that _**promotes**_ reduction (Bybee 2001, 2002; Timberlake 1978)

$reader$
- For example, the rate of word-final t/d deletion
in English is lower for words that are more likely to occur in the context
of a following vowel in speech (Guy 1991; Bybee 2002).
- Similarly, reduction rates of word-initial [s] in Spanish are higher for words that are more
likely to occur in the context of a preceding non-high vowel in speech
(Brown 2004, 2006). 
$/reader$
$/acco$

#### Motivation for reduction

automation
- reduction is the result of the **automation of production processes** (Bybee 2001, 2002)
- claimed to result in more **casual, reduced forms**
- ultimately: registered as change in lexical representation

$widec$
$down ??
$/widec$

*nature* of reduction
- basic frequency of use should occur **uniformly** across the word
- however: it occurs on certain segments or syllables

$widec$
$down why?
$/widec$

influence of lexical structure and discourse environments
- leads to differential articulatory effects, automation processes (and ultimately, reduction)

$wide$
- => in a study, you have to control for all of these factors
$/wide$

$p=38$

$reader$
In the current study whether word frequency plays an independent role
in on-line _s-_ reduction is addressed by **controlling both word frequency
and frequency of occurrence of a word in phonological environments known
to promote articulatory reduction of [s-]**. The effects of **other probabilistic
measures** are also assessed, to determine whether they contribute to s- reduction. 
Both intra- and extra-lexical phonological contexts are controlled, and
comparison of their effects is used to determine to what extent reduction can
be attributed to lexical representations or on-line articulatory processes.
$/reader$

### Data and methods

$p=41$

$reader$
As an illustration of the measures in Table 2, consider the excerpt from
the corpus transcription in (1).

1. . . . _a mi sobrino, porque yo_ . . .  
. . . to my nephew, because I . . .

The s- word _sobrino_ in the token in (1)
occurs 11 times in the NMCOSS corpus, giving it a frequency per million
of 146 and a log frequency of 2.17. The preceding word bigram in this
token is _mi sobrino_, which has a frequency in the corpus statistics of 6,
and the frequency of the word preceding the s- word, _mi_, is 485, so that
the predictability of _sobrino_ from _mi_ is 6/485 = .0124. The s- of _sobrino_ in
this token is followed (word-internally) by the non-high vowel /o/, which
is a context hypothesized to favor s- reduction. However, 
the vowel preceding s- is the high vowel /i/ in _mi_, which is hypothesized not to favor
reduction. Overall in the corpus the word _sobrino_ occurs after a non-high
vowel (/o/, /a/, or /e/) only once, giving _sobrino_ a FFC of 1/11 = .091.
The frequency with which /i/ precedes /s/ at a word boundary in the
corpus is 407, and the log of this frequency per million phones is 2.61.

### Results

$p=44-45$

$wide$
- main effect of preceding and following phonological contexts of s-
	- non-high vowels (before) predict higher reduction rates (2.41 times more likely)
	- non-high vowels (after) predict higher reduction rates (3.03 times more likely)
- no lexical stress on the initial syllable of an s-word predicts higher reduction (1.59 times more likely)
- predictability hardly leads to higher reduction (1.01 times -- so 1% -- more likely)

### Discussion

reduction effects
- both **==extra-==** and **==intra-lexical== factors**
- cumulative experience (frequency) factor and context

$p=48$

$reader$
- <span style="color: red;">The effect of the predictability of the s- word from the preceding word was small.</span>
- However, the effect of FFC [(frequency in a favourable context -- how often does the 
word occur before a vowel conducive to reduction?)] was robust and confirms earlier findings that **FFC
encourages reduction in studies that did not control other probabilistic
factors** (Brown 2004, 2006). The effect of FFC indicates that **the _cumulative experience_ 
of words in reducing phonological contexts of non-high
preceding vowels results in a greater likelihood of reduction than context
of use alone can explain**. The effect suggests that reduction of s- reflects
changes in the lexical representations of words **through cumulative experience** 
with these words in reductive production contexts. 
$/reader$

$p=49$

$reader$
The <span style="color: red;">failure to find any robust effects of the non-contextual word and
phone unit probabilities</span> after controlling the contextual variables suggests
that **<span style="color: red;">speakers are sensitive to how often a word occurs in environments that
encourage reduction</span>**, but not measurably to non-contextual probabilistic
measures of use. Consequently, an s- word’s frequency did not predict /s-/
reduction.
$/reader$

$reader$
How can <span style="color: red;">the failure to find a significant effect of word frequency</span> on 
s-reduction in datasets analyzed be reconciled with other studies, in which
word frequency effects on a range of reductive processes have been reported?

- As noted, in most of these studies **the likelihood of a word occurring in a
reducing environment was not controlled**. With respect to phonological
context, the environments promoting reduction are generally identifiable,
and tests of their importance could be readily made. 
- However, other variables not examined in this study may also promote reduction differentially
across the word frequency range.
	- For example, higher rates of speech are
associated with reduction, and words may differ in their likelihood of
being produced at high speech rates.
	- In addition to a direct effect of speech
rate on reduction, **higher frequency words may, in particular, be more
likely to be produced in contexts with higher speech rates than lower
frequency words**. Because faster speech rates may encourage reduction,
high frequency words would thus have a higher probability of occurring
in this reducing environment.

## Frequency, conservative gender systems and the language-learning child: Changing systems of pronominal reference in Dutch

----
$widec$
Gunther De Vogelaer

$p=3$

$reader$
**Summary**

De Vogelaer studies the gender systems of Dutch dialects. More specifically, 
he starts out from the fact that Standard Dutch exhibits a gender
mismatch of the binary article system and the ternary pronominal system
and explores to what degree this historical change is affected by frequency
effects. Results from a questionnaire study, in which subjects were put in
a position to decide on the gender of nouns, indicate high- and low-frequency items 
behave differently: the former are affected in particular
by standardization whereas the latter are influenced more by resemanticization.
However, the study also cautions us that different types of data
can yield very different results with regard to the effect of frequency. De
Vogelaer compares frequency data from the 9-million-word Spoken Dutch
Corpus to age-of-acquisition data from a target vocabulary list. Correlation 
coefficients indicate that the process of standardization is more correlated with 
the adult spoken corpus frequencies whereas resemanticization
is more correlated with the age-of-acquisition data. As De Vogelaer puts
it, ‘‘frequency effects are typically poly-interpretable,’’ and he rightly advises
readers to regularly explore different frequency measures and register-specific frequencies.

### Introduction: change and variation in Dutch gender and frequency

#### Grammatical gender and pronominal gender

----
$widec$
Present-day Standard Dutch differs from historical varieties of the language
in that **the difference between the marking of masculine and feminine
gender is levelled out**
$/widec$
----

Standard Dutch
- has two definite articles
	1. common *de*
	2. neuter *het*
- difference is further only distinguished in adjectival inflection in indefinite NPs
	- e.g _een mooi-e man/vrouw_ ‘a beautiful man/woman’ vs. _een mooi kind_ ‘a beautiful child’

$result mismatch!
- three genders (reflected in pronouns), but not in morphology

$result consequence
- **reshuffle** of pronominal gender (especially in reference to inanimates)
- $see $down

$reader$
[W]hile pronominal gender traditionally matched
the grammatical gender of the antecedent inanimate noun, northern varieties
of Dutch, including Standard Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands, seem
to be shifting towards a **_semantic_ system of pronominal gender**, operating
along the lines of the **Individuation Hierarchy** (Siemund 2002; Audring
2006, 2009): **highly individuated nouns** (including neuter words such as
_masker_ ‘mask’ and _apparaat_ ‘device’; cf. Audring 2009: 86) increasingly
**trigger the use of masculine pronouns** such as _hij_ ‘he’ or _hem_ ‘him’, **weakly
individuated ones** (including common nouns such as spinazie ‘spinach’ and
_wol_ ‘wool’; cf. Audring 2009: 98) **combine with neuter** _het_ ‘it’.

still stands strong**, more specifically on West and East Flemish dialects. In
these dialects any instances of **semantically-motivated pronouns are highly
ambiguous** with respect to the mechanism of language change explaining
them: these instances may exemplify ongoing change within these varieties,
but they may also be adopted from varieties of Dutch in which semantic
agreement occurs more often.
$/reader$

$reader$
In addition, not all changes in the choice
of a pronoun referring to an antecedent noun are due to resemanticisation.
Apart from resemanticisation there is also variation in that many nouns
have a different gender in the traditional dialects than in the standard
language. In more recent times, extensive levelling is causing these dialects
to converge to Standard Dutch, so it is likely that many nouns having a
different gender in the dialect than in Standard Dutch are under pressure
to switch gender.

#### Frequency effects as explanators

- may cast light on which part of the changes is explained by which mechanism of change

$reader$
One wellknown hypothesis regarding frequency is that conservative features in
language are preserved longer in high frequency items (see, e.g., Bybee
and Hopper 2001: 17–18; Corbett, Hippisley, Brown, and Marriot 2001;
Smith 2001)
$/reader$

#### Exact mechanism

$reader$
**Reason for conservation**

According to Phillips (2006: 87), this characterisation holds
for all changes that are implemented in cases <span style="color: red;">**‘when memory fails’**</span>, for
instance in sound changes affecting words of which the phonetic word
form is <span style="color: red;">**not well entrenched in memory**</span>, which drives speakers to choose
pronunciations motivated by surface phonetics, pronunciations analogous
to other patterns in the language, or, in general terms, innovations requiring
‘‘access to generalisations that have emerged from word forms’’ (Phillips
2006: 157). Changes _directly_ involving the production of word forms, 
however, affect the most frequent words first (e.g. deletion, assimilation, . . .).
$/reader$

$reader$
**Intra and extradialectal innovation**

- From the hypothesis that infrequent items are likely to be affected by
innovations motivated by generalisations that have emerged from word
forms, it follows that **Phillips’ generalisation typically holds in situations
where the innovation originates _within_ a speech community**.
- Thus in
situations of innovation **diffusion through _contact_ with other varieties,
other regularities may be at work**. At the moment there are contradictory
opinions in the literature, however, as to whether dialect contact leads to
change especially in high or low-frequency items. **The most widely held
opinion seems to be that exposure, and hence high frequency, increases
the likelihood of change**.

#### The confusing duality of high frequency

high frequency = probability of change

Phillips (2006) reaches this conclusion in an **inductive manner**, by generalising
over a large set of examples of language change. She **does not, however, provide 
a principled account of why high-frequency items are more liable to
change involving mere word forms, even though they are allegedly more
entrenched in language users’ minds**.

- One principled reason could be that **types of contact that do not affect 
high-frequency items are too weak to have
any effect at all**.
- Alternatively, it could also be the case that **effects are observed, but not on the community level**. 
	- Thus, some low frequency items may be affected by the contact situation in the language of a number of individual language users, but **these effects disappear if the data for individuals are pooled in larger data sets**.
	- It would take an experimental setting to verify whether such an account is plausible.

### Investigating gender in East and West Flemish dialects of Dutch

#### Gender in Dutch: the progressive north <-> the conservative south

$reader$
The Dutch gender system has been undergoing change for centuries,
thereby gradually decreasing the number of exponents of the grammatical
three-gender system observed in the oldest documented varieties of the
language: while Middle Dutch case inflection of articles, adjectives and
nouns themselves revealed whether a given noun was masculine, feminine
or neuter, present-day varieties of Dutch have dispensed with most of their
adnominal morphology. Thus, case marking has gone and little gender
agreement is left (cf. Geerts 1966). The processes of change have unevenly
affected different varieties of Dutch. More particularly, they have resulted
in massive geographical variation in the domain of gender marking at the
level of the dialects (as described most recently in De Schutter et al. 2005),
and also in smaller differences between varieties of the standard language.
$/reader$

$p=114$

|two-gender dialect|three-gender dialect|
|---|---|
|common and neuter gender|masculine, feminine, neuter gender|

$reader$
In correspondence with the conservative nature of their adnominal
gender system, southern varieties of Dutch have by and large preserved
the traditional system of pronominal reference: anaphoric pronouns may
be masculine, feminine and neuter, and are **chosen on the basis of a noun’s
grammatical gender.** 
$/reader$

$p=115$

$reader$
Hence pronominal gender in these varieties differs
from northern varieties of Dutch, especially in reference to inanimates,
in that **the vast majority of pronominal references in the south of the
language area are still in line with the triadic distinction between masculine, 
feminine and neuter nouns** (see Geeraerts 1992 for figures). This is
**no longer the case in areas where two-gender dialects of Dutch are spoken**.
$/reader$

[ The pronominal genders of northern, progressive variants of Dutch ]
|hij|zij|het|
|---|---|---|
|highly individuated words|female persons and animals|hardly individuated forms|

$reader$
Unlike for adnominal gender, where
only two-gender systems are considered part of the standard language,
little or no normative pressure exists to adopt a three- or a two-gender
grammatical system for pronominal reference (see, e.g., Haeseryn et al.
2002: 161–162).
$/reader$

$p=116$

==resemanticisation==
- the development by which pronominal gender is reorganised in terms of individuation
- can also be considered an instance of ==**morphological regularisation**==, in which a system that has grown opaque is brought in line with a number of transparent rules (see also De Vos and De Vogelaer 2011)

$p=117$

$reader$
Thus the degree to which speakers engage in resemanticisation reflects the
transparency of the masculine-feminine distinction in grammar, or, put
differently, the frequency with which these speakers are exposed to nonstandard 
gender agreement markers unambiguously distinguishing masculine and feminine gender (see also Hoppenbrouwers 1983).
$/reader$

#### A complication: changing lexical gender

$p=118$

$reader$
Pauwels (1938) discusses the gender of a large number of nouns in
Belgian Dutch dialects as documented in the late 19th century, including
many East and West Flemish dialects. It appears that all these dialects at
the time had preserved the grammatical three-gender system, but there is a
lot of variation on the lexical level: nouns that are masculine in one dialect
may be feminine or neuter elsewhere. For instance, _bos_ ‘forest’ is masculine 
in some dialects, but neuter in others; _kraag_ ‘collar’ is feminine in
some dialects, masculine in others, etc. Some nouns, like _suiker_ ‘sugar’,
can even be masculine, feminine, and neuter, depending on the dialect in
which they are used. Since this variation has emerged in the history of
Dutch, **it appears that nouns may change gender in the course of history**
(see Geerts 1966 for examples).

It appears that in the
Flemish dialects there is indeed a statistically significant e¤ect to use the
neuter pronoun het ‘it’ to refer to mass nouns and abstracts, whether they
are grammatically neuter or not: the ratio of het ‘it’ answers is higher for
non-neuter mass nouns and abstracts than for non-neuter concrete count
nouns: 16.3% (286/1752 answers) vs. 5.5% (98/1792); all nouns neuter in
Standard Dutch have been kept out of the analysis. This effect is statistically 
significant (chi square = 108, d(f ) ¼ 1; p < .001; OR = 3.39). 
$/reader$

$example$
**Examples with stron gremanticisation**

Examples of nouns from the questionnaire with a **strong tendency towards
resemanticisation**, i.e. reference with _het_ ‘it’, are:

- _achterdocht_ ‘suspicion’ with 42.5%
- _beet_ ‘bite’ 37.8%
-  _pels_ ‘fur (mass noun)’ 24.6%
- _olie_ ‘oil’ 23.2% and 
- _kalk_ ‘lime’ 21.7%

**Examples with weak resemanticisation**


- _peper_ ‘pepper’ 3.0% 
- _chocolade_ ‘chocolate’ 3.0%.

$reader$
As in Standard Dutch, resemanticisation **seems to affect pronominal gender
only** (cf. similar tendencies in other Germanic varieties, as described by
Siemund 2002 and Audring 2006). Quite surprisingly, as was already
noted in section 3.1, no tendency is observed to extend masculine _hij_ ‘he’
to all concrete count nouns.

The argument is made that this resemanticisation is a spontaneous development, and not a copy from northern Dutch.

- children who are acquiring language

$reader$
- For the resemanticisation of Dutch pronominal
gender, it is relevant that children appear to **start from semantically 
motivated systems of pronominal gender**, which are **given up in favour
of a grammatical system as they grow older**.
- According to De Houwer
(1987), who investigates a child acquiring a southern variety of Standard
Dutch, pronominal reference in three-year old children mainly operates
on the basis of the **animate-inanimate distinction**: animate entities are
referred to with _hij_ ‘he’; for inanimate entities both _hij_ ‘he’ and _het_ ‘it’ are
found. The motivation to use _hij_ ‘he’ vis-a`-vis _het_ ‘it’ remains unclear in
De Houwer’s account, but given the [number] of deviations from the adult
system, grammatical gender hardly plays a role. 
- At the age of 7, noun
semantics are still the main factor underlying pronominal reference (De
Vogelaer 2010). Not only the animate-inanimate distinction but also **mass-count** 
and **concrete-abstract** play a crucial role: both mass nouns and
abstracts tend to trigger the use of the neuter pronoun _het_ ‘it’ even when
they are not grammatically neuter. Nevertheless, substantial proportions
of pronominal reference are in line with grammatical gender (De Paepe
and De Vogelaer 2008). 
- Significantly, **during adolescence the semantically
driven usage of _het_ ‘it’ further decreases in favour of pronominal reference
in line with grammatical gender**, but even at the age of 18–20 the adolescents 
**do not quite attain the same proportions of grammatical gender as
previous generations** (De Vos 2009; De Vos and De Vogelaer 2011).
$/reader$

$p=126$

$reader$
**The arbitrariness of Dutch gender**

These results on Dutch pronominal gender are all the more striking
since in other languages in which pronouns agree in gender with their
antecedent nouns, the grammatical system appears to be mastered already
at a very young age, to the extent that deviations from grammatical gender
are extremely rare. Thus, German children of six hardly deviate from a
noun’s grammatical gender in pronominal reference (Mills 1986: 92), and
the same holds for French-speaking children (Maillart 2003; Van der
Velde 2003: 328, 340). This is likely due to the arbitrariness of the Dutch
gender system: gender of nouns referring to inanimates is not motivated
semantically in Dutch, nor are there any clues in the form of (monomorphemic) 
nouns that allow to determine gender (Durieux, Daelemans and
Gillis 1999). Hence children acquiring Dutch can only derive nouns’
gender from the form of adnominal modifiers and pronouns, not from
the form and/or meaning of the noun itself. This situation contrasts sharply
with German and French, where gender assignment is at least partly
motivated by semantic and/or formal regularities (see, e.g., Mills 1986
and Köpcke and Zubin 1996 on German, and Tucker, Lambert and
Rigault 1977 on French). Such regularities minimise memory load, and
are well-known to contribute to the acquirability of gender systems (Frigo
and McDonald 1998; Gerken, Wilson and Lewis 2005).
$/reader$

$reader$
More precisely,
**the acquisition of grammatical gender in pronominal reference should be
conceived of as a process of ‘un-learning’** to use semantically motivated
pronouns.

### Frequency effects

#### Frequency, and mechanisms of language change

$p=127$

##### Theoretical reflections

$reader$
**Frequency effects recap**

The role of frequency in linguistic change 
has been investigated extensively with respect to phonological change (see,
e.g., Hooper 1976; Bybee 1995, 2001; Phillips 1984, 2001, 2006). 
The relevance of word frequency has been highlighted repeatedly, e.g. by Hooper
(1976), who discusses two different frequency effects: on the one hand,
processes of phonetic reduction are first visible in highly frequent items,
whereas, on the other hand, processes of regularisation typically affect
low-frequency items. In a survey of potential frequency effects in grammar,
Bybee and Hopper (2001: 10–19) mention several types of frequency
effects relating to language change, among which effects boiling down to
a tendency in high-frequency patterns to engage in innovations (grammaticalization, 
lexicalization of multi-word-patterns, formal reduction, . . .),
but also conservative effects in high-frequency patterns, such as the retention 
of certain morphological properties. Phillips (2006: 157) proposes that
innovations implemented as speakers memory fails to provide the traditional variant 
typically affect low frequency items, whereas changes directly
involving the production of word forms as stored in memory affect the most
frequent words first.
$/reader$

$reader$
**Dialect contact and salience**

In addition to playing a role in sound change and other processes of
‘regular’ linguistic change, frequency is found to play a role in dialect 
contact. Thus, Trudgill (1986: 11–21, 43–53) describes processes of long-term
accommodation of one dialect towards another, and observes that salient
features are adopted more easily.~4~ It is rather obvious that, all other
properties being equal, highly frequent features are more salient than
infrequent features, and thus Trudgill’s observations lead to suggest that
frequent items of the donor variety will be easily borrowed by the target
variety. According to Phillips (2006: 141), however, such contact-induced
changes will only affect high frequency items provided that there are no
‘ideological’ reasons for doing otherwise (cf. also Trudgill 1986: 17–19,
125 on ‘extra-strong salience’) and if the relevant change directly involves
the production of the relevant word form.

~4~ Dialect contact is understood here in a broad sense, i.e. as including contact
between dialects and prestige varieties such as Standard Dutch.

likely **frequent items first**
- language users are more likely to adopt a noun’s Standard
Dutch gender the more they are exposed to the relevant noun

$info$
It should be
noted, however, that this hypothesis is only valid for speakers for whom the
dialect is their ‘base variety’, and for whom the standard language is their
second dialect. While this situation is common across older speakers in the
Dutch language area, recent investigations into dialect usage in younger
generations (especially Rys 2007) have revealed that it is nowadays probably
more accurate to consider Standard Dutch to be the native dialect of
children growing up in Belgium, since the acquisition of the dialect primarily
takes place in adolescence, and is characterised by overgeneralisations
typically found in second dialect acquisition. 
$/info$

$reader$
- On the one hand, dialect
geographical data indicated that resemanticisation in Flemish is **likely not
taken over from other varieties** (De Vogelaer and De Sutter 2011).
	- Hence
resemanticisation can be characterised as a **development taking place
_within_ a speech community**, more specifically as a type of **regularisation**, a
kind of innovation **being implemented as speakers’ memories fail (Phillips
2006: 157)**. 
	- This characterisation leads to believe that the phenomenon
will be found primarily in **low-frequency items**.
- On the other hand, it
remains at least theoretically possible that **resemanticisation is diffused
from northern Dutch on a word-by-word basis**.
	- Assuming that the liability
to semantically motivated pronominalisation may be **lexically specific**
(cf. Smith 2001: 365, 373–374 and Poplack 2001: 411–414 on the potential
of morpho-syntactic traits to be lexically specific), and that patterns of
semantic agreement may be **diffused** from one variety to another, this
creates a **potential for highly frequent items to trigger semantic agreement
more easily**.

$reader$
In a way, both the adoption of Standard Dutch gender and the acquisition 
of a noun’s grammatical gender (which makes the noun less susceptible
to resemanticisation) can be described as **learning processes**. Hence it is
expected that the influence of frequency on both phenomena is best described 
by means of a **‘learning curve’**: the **first instances of a Standard
Dutch noun will contribute stronger to the standardisation process than
any succeeding ones**, whereas **the first instances of a noun will also be
more crucial for children to determine the noun’s grammatical gender
during acquisition** (cf. also Hay and Baayen 2002: 208, who observe that
differences amongst lower frequencies often are more salient than equivalent 
differences amongst higher frequencies). Therefore, rather than testing
for correlations between the observed changes and raw frequency data, a
**logarithmic transformation has been applied on the frequency data** (which
indeed yields better fits).
$/reader$

#### Dialect contact affects high frequency items

$reader$
In order to investigate the role of frequency, for each word on the questionnaire 
the strength was calculated with which it is affected by each of
the investigated tendencies. For instance, for the noun _bos_ ‘forest’ 92
answers are available from regions where _bos_ is traditionally a masculine
noun, whereas it is neuter in Standard Dutch. In 74 cases, the neuter pronoun 
_het_ ‘it’ was given as an answer. This means that _bos_ ‘forest’ shows a
standardisation ratio of 74/92 or 80%. This figure can then be correlated
with the frequency data, i.e. both with (the logarithmic transformations
of ) the noun’s score on Schaerlaekens, Kohnstamm, and Lejaegere’s (2000)
Target Vocabulary List and the noun’s frequency in the Spoken Dutch
Corpus.

From this it can be concluded that standardisation, at least in gender change, 
mainly affects highly
frequent items: **highly frequent items tend to shift towards Standard Dutch
gender more easily**.

#### Transmission and low frequency items

Both the table and the scatter plot indicate that **items high on the target
vocabulary list resist resemanticisation**. The very same elements are believed
to be acquired early and to be the most frequent items in young children’s
speech (Vervoorn 1989: 40, 46; cf. section 4.1). The fact that the target
vocabulary list yields much clearer results adds support to the idea that
resemanticisation relates to the language acquisition process, providing
an extra argument to consider it **change through ‘imperfect transmission’**.
$/reader$

$p=135$

$reader$
Significantly, **the frequency data from the CGN do not correlate with
resemanticisation**. This may in part be due to the fact that the investigation 
only targeted a limited number of nouns, for which corpus frequency
and target list score correlate less strongly than for most nouns. 
$/reader$

$p=136$

$warn$
Watch out with the interpretation of **"frequency"**!

$reader$
On the
basis of the stronger correlations calculated by Vervoorn (1989: 64–65),
it can be expected that **large-scale investigations will reveal statistically
significant correlations between resemanticisation and frequency data
drawn from adults** (such as CGN frequency). Indeed De Vos (2009) detects
**clear frequency effects with respect to the proportion of pronominal 
references in line with grammatical gender, using frequency data from adults
rather than children**. <span style="color: red;">This, in turn, underscores the **poly-interpretability
of frequency effects**: within the domain of diachronic research, frequency
effects may reflect liability on a language pattern’s part to engage in
processes of routinization (grammaticalization, phonetic reduction, . . .),
different degrees of entrenchment in grammar, different ages of acquisition,
etc.</span> Hence researchers should be <span style="color: red;">**very explicit on the nature of frequency
effects in their data**</span>, and on the underlying explanation.
<span style="color: red;">**In many cases,
frequency effects will merely reflect some deeper property of language
patterns rather than being a conclusive explanation in their own right.**</span>

The data in this chapter are a case in point: during processes of standardisation, 
**frequency effects reflect the intensity with which dialect speakers
are exposed to nouns’ standard language gender**; in resemanticisation,
frequency effects reveal different ages at which nouns are acquired by children,
which appears to influence the odds that these nouns’ grammatical
gender can be learned successfully.
