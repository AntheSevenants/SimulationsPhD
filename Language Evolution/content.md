Consensus

**1.** interdisciplinarity
- language evolution must be approached from many disciplines

$p=13$

**2.** growing interest in mathematical and computational modelling
- $see $down

$reader$
<span style="color: red;">Models are useful because they allow researchers to test particular theories about the mechanisms underlying the evolution of language. **Given the number of different factors that may potentially influence language evolution, our intuitions about their complex interactions are often limited. It is exactly in these circumstances, when multiple processes have to be considered together, that modelling becomes a useful -- and <u>perhaps even necessary</u> -- tool.**</span>

In this book, modelling work has been used to inform theories about biological adaptations for grammar (Pinker, Dunbar, Briscoe, Komarova and Nowak, Chapters 2, 12, 16, and 17), about the emergence of language structure through cultural transmission (Hurford, Deacon, Kirby and Christiansen, Chapters 3, 7, and 15), and about the evolution of phonetic gesture systems (Studdert-Kennedy and Goldsten, Chapter 13).

We envisage that the interest in mathematical and computational modelling is likely to increase even further, especially as it becomes more sophisticated in terms of both psychological mechanisms and linguistic complexity.

Language itself is rather difficult to define, existing as it does both as transitory utterances that leave no trace, and as patterns of neural connectivity in the natural world's most complex brains. It is never stationary, changing over time and within populations which themselves are dynamic. It is infinitely flexible and (almost) universally present. It is by far the most complex behaviour we know of [...].

## Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche

### Introduction

central theory
- human language faculty is a complex biological adaptation that evolved by natural selection for communication in a knowledge-using, socially interdependent lifestyle

### The design of human language

$p=17$

#### Words

mental lexicon
- a finite memorized list of words

word
- an arbitrary sign
 a connection between a signal and a concept, shared by members of the community

==bidirectionality of symbols==
- 'if I can use a word, I can understand it when someone else uses it, and vice versa'

#### Grammar

grammar
- combining words into larger words, phrases and sentences
- (the further characterisation of grammar is decisively Chomskyan, nvda.)

$p=21$

#### Interfaces of language with other parts of the mind

parts of the mind interfacing with language
- grammar
- perception
- articulation
- conceptual knowledge (provides the meanings of words and their relationships)
- social knowledge (how language can be used and interpreted in a social context)

$info$
nvda. Cognitive Grammar assumes many of these aspects are *NOT* separated and part of the same structure.

### Is language an adaptation?

adaptation
- a trait whose genetic basis was shaped by natural selection

#### Is language a distinct part of the human phenotype?

language as general cognitive abilities
- the combination of many cognitive abilities lead to language facility

$p=23$

### Did language evolve by means other than natural selection?

theory
- language evolved 'all at once' as the product of a macromutation
- bruh

$p=26$

### What did language evolve for?

$p=27$

#### The cognitive niche

the cognitive niche
- the unified explanation of the many human traits that are unusual in the rest of the living world
	- e.g. children, family, community, culture ...
	- => language at the centre

$p=29$

#### Alternatives to the cognitive niche theory

**1.** deception  
(Dawkins and Krebs)
- language evolved to deceive and manipulate other people
- but: this doesn't make sense communicatively -> no *raison d'Ãªtre* for language

$p=30$

**2.** thinking
- language evolved to allow us to think rather than to communicate
- "it is impossible to think at human levels of complexity without a representational medium" (Bickerton 1990)
- but: this assumes a strong Whorfian view on cognition, skips grammar

**3.** grooming
- (from Freek's class) language as social alternative for grooming in larger groups (Dunbar 1998)

**4.** courtship device
- language to advertise the fitness of our brains (Miller 2000)

### New tests of the theory that language is an adaptation

#### Language and evolutionary game theory

$reader$
Evolutionary game theory has allowed biologists to predict how organisms ought to interact with other organisms co-evolving their own strategies (Maynard Smith 1982). Language, like sex, aggression and cooperation, is a game it takes two to play, and game theory can provide the external criteria for utility enjoyed by the rest of evolutionary biology.

Modellers assume only that the transmission of information between partners provides them with an advantage (say, by exchanging information or coordinating their behaviour), and that the advantage translates into more offspring, with similar communicative skills.

The question then is how a stable communication system might evolve from repeated pairwise interactions and, crucially, whether such systems have the major design features of human language.

**1.** Hurford (1989)
- arbitrary, bi-directional sign will drive out other schemes over time

$p=31-21$

**2.** Nowak et al. (1999, 2000)
- errors in signalling or perception are inevitable, especially when signals are physically similar
- usefulness of syntax to reduce memory load

$p=33$

#### Language and molecular evolution

$reader$
Mathematical models and computer simulations can show that the advantages claimed for some features of language really can evolve by known mechanisms of natural selection. These models cannot, of course, show that language *in fact* evolved according to the proposed scenario.

### Biological steps to language-readiness: pre-adaptations

pre-adaptation
- a change in a species which is not itself adaptive (= selectively neutral)
- but: paves the way for subsequent adaptive changes

$reader$
For example, bipedalism set in train anatomical changes which culminated in the human vocal tract. Though speech is clearly adaptive, bipedalism itself it not an adaptation for speech; it is a pre-adaptation.

1. _pre-phonetic_ capacity to perform speech sounds or manual gestures
2. _pre-syntactic_ capacity to organise longer sequences of sounds or gestures
3. _pre-semantic_ capacities
	- to form basic concepts
	- to construct more complex concepts (e.g. prepositions)
	- to carry out mental calculations over complex concepts
4. _pre-pragmatic_ capacities
	- to infer what mental calculations others can carry out
	- to act cooperatively
	- to attend to the same external situations as others
	- to accept symbolic action as a surrogate for real action
5. an *elementary symbolic* capacity to link sounds or gestures arbitrarily with basic concepts, such that perception of the action activates the concept, and attention to the concept may initiate the sound or gesture

#### Grammaticalisation

grammaticalisation
- syntactic organisation, and the overt markers associated with it, emerges from non-syntactic, principally lexical and dicrouse, organisation
- spiralling interaction of the two phases of language's existence, I-language and E-language

$info$
This is still a very formal way of looking at things. Still, this was 2003, so cut the man a little slack.

unidirectionality

#### Computer modelling of language evolution

computer modellers of emerging language
- start from simulated populations with *no language at all*
- simulations can lead to interesting results in which the populations have converged on ordinated communicative codes which, though still extremely simple, share noteworthy characteristics with human language

$p=54$

$example$
- Batali (1998; 2002)
- Kirby (200; 2002)
- Hurford (2000)
- Teal and Taylor (1999)
- Tonkes and Wiles (2002)

A survey of some of these works, analysing their principle dimensions, and the issues they raise, appears in Hurford (2002).
$/example$

iterated learning models
- do not attempt 'to put everything together' and reach a full language-like outcome
- rather: explore interactions between pairs of strictly isolated factors relevant to the iterated learning model (e.g. Brighton and Kirby 2001)

$p=55$

$reader$
This strand of computational simulation research has the potential to clarify the essentials of the interaction between (a) the psychological capacities of language learners and (b) the historical dynamics of populations of learners giving rise to complex grammars resembling the grammars of real natural languages.

In such simulations, a population of agents begins with no shared system of communication. The agents are 'innately' endowed with certain competencies, typically including control of a space of possible meanings, an inventory of possible signals, and a capacity for acquiring grammars of certain specified sorts on exposure to examples of meaning-signal pairs.

The simulations typically proceed with each generation learning from its predecessor, on the basis of observation of its communicative behaviour. At first, there is no coherent communicative behaviour in the simulated population. Over time, a coherent shared syntactic system emerges. The syntactic systems which have been achieved in this research paradigm are all, of course, simpler than real attested languages, but nevertheless possess many of the central traits of natural language syntactic organisation, including recursivity, compositionality of meaning, asymmetric distribution of regular and irregular forms according to frequency, grammatical functional elements with no denotational meaning, grammatical markers of passive voice and of reflexivity, and elementary partitioning into phrases.

computer simulations and invisible hand
- summed independent actions if individuals
- but: not intentionally constructed by any individual

$reader$
Simulations within an ILM framework strip the interaction between individuals down to the bare minimum from which language-like systems can be shown to emerge. The key property of these models is that each new generation learns its language from a restricted set of exemplars produced by the preceding generation.

**1.** drift
- the gradual accumulation of accidental mutations over long periods of time
- e.g. mispronunciations, unintended slippages of meaning ...

**2.** need to differentiate communities
- 'freerider' -> the individual who takes the benefits of cooperations, but does not pay the costs
- (Nettle 1999 simulation)
- dialects are particularly well designed to act as badges of group membership that allow everyone to identify members of their exchange group

$p=232$

$reader$
Beyond this, however, we have little real understanding of the processes involved in either dialect change or language evolution, or for that matter in the functions that these processes subserve. We assume that these functions are largely social, and we have some understanding of the types of process that can precipitate language change (trade, colonisation, emulation of culturally or economically superior groups, etc.), but by and large there is little other than conjecture to explain why these processes exist or why they should work in the way they do.

<span style="color: red;">Part of the problem is, of course, the temporal scale on which these changes occur (generations in the case of dialects, perhaps lmillennia in the case of languages). Inevitably, this makes it all but impossible for us to observe the process first-hand.</span>
