# Principles of linguistic change 2 - social factors

$public=true$

$p=3$

## The Darwinian Paradox

$p=4$

### The social effects of language change

$p=5$

why does language change?
- on the communicative side, there is little benefit for an ever-changing language system

$p=6$

### The parallels between biological and linguistic evolution

$p=9$

'natural selection' in linguistics
- the better, the shorter and the easier forms survive

$wide$
- $result no support for this idea!
$/wide$

$p=10$

$reader$
Taking linguistic change as a whole, **there seems to be no discernible movement toward greater efficiency** such as might be expected if in fact there were
a continuous struggle in which superior linguistic innovations won out as a
general rule. (Greenberg 1959:69)
$/reader$

$result universal view of linguists
- *reverse* of Darwin's natural selection
- major agent of linguistic change -- sound change -- causes a *loss* of information of the original forms

#### Language change as a destructive force

$widec$
(sound change used to be seen as a negative process, even by people like Rasmus Rask and Jakob Grimm and Alexander von Humboldt)
$/widec$

$p=11$

#### The linguistic consequences of sound change

$p=12$

loss of phonological information
- also leads to a loss of information
- e.g. French plural *-s* no longer pronounced

$p=15$

### Earlier proposals for the causes of sound change

causes of sound change
- very difficult to find

----
$widec$
Three basic arguments for the causes of sound change ($see $down)
$/widec$
----

$p=16$

#### Principle of least effort

$reader$
It is safe to say that **we speak as rapidly and with as little effort as possible**,
approaching always the limit where our interlocutors ask us to repeat our
utterance, and that a great deal of sound-change is in some way connected
with this factor. (Bloomfield 1933 : 386)
$/reader$

$p=17$

principle of least effort
- "the reduction of phonetic forms, *exactly before the point where the information would be lost*"
- often associated with pace of speaking
- primarily applies to change of manner (not place of articulation) (p. 25)

$reader$
On the other hand, ignorance has no direct relationship either to tempo
or to the principle of least effort. If the speakers described by Whitney are
indeed ignorant of classical and time-honored usages and of valuable distinctions, 
the changes in their language cannot be ascribed to the principle
of least effort. Thus in the course of a merger, speakers who are aware of
the distinction between whale and wail might neglect it through carelessness
or laziness; it is their **children** who would then complete the sound change
through **ignorance of the distinction**.
$/reader$

$wide$
- $result (nvda). you need a generational gap to complete sound changes -> children have no notion of the distinctions from the past
$/wide$

$p=18$

##### Speech tempo

tempo of speech
- may be a distinct factor in sound change

$p=19$

potential for sound change
- over time, some of the contractions become institutionalised in the more formal structure of the language, or as underlying forms

#### Principle of density

$reader$
The reason for this intense local differentiation is evidently to be sought
in the **principle of density**. Every speaker is constantly adapting his speech 
habits to those of his interlocutors; he gives up forms he has been using,
adopts new ones, and perhaps oftenest of all, changes the frequency of
speech-forms without entirely abandoning any old ones or accepting any
that are really new to him. **The inhabitants of a settlement, village, or town,
however, talk much more to each other than to persons who live elsewhere**.
When any innovation in the way of speaking spreads over a district, the
limit of this spread is sure to be along some lines ofweakness in the network
of oral communication, and these lines of weakness, in so far as they are
topographical lines, are the boundaries between towns, villages, and settlements. (Bloomfield 1933:476)
$/reader$

$result limitation of spreading
- you talk more to people you are close to
- this concentrates innovations around that area

$p=23$

#### Principle of imitation

$reader$
It appears to me almost beyond dispute that language is a **phenomenon
of imitation**: its propagation from high to low, from superior to inferior,
whether it be without or within the nation, the acquisition of foreign words
by fashion and their assimilation by custom, the contagion of accent, the
tyranny of usage in itself, suffices to show at one glance its imitative character.
(Tarde 1873: ch. 5)
$/reader$

$p=25$

### Different kinds of sound change

#### Sound shifts

sound shifts
- shifts that change the place of articulation

motivation?
- not principle of least effort
- not an optimisation of rule systems
- not an imitation of a dominant group (probably)

$p=26$

#### Lenition

lenition
- "a sound change that alters consonants, making them more sonorous" (Wikipedia)

#### Mergers and splits

$p=27$

#### Deletions

$p=28$

### The narrow interface between language and society

$p=29$

### The social location of the innovators

$p=30$

----
$widec$
Where are the innovators who start sound change?
$/widec$
----

$p=30-31$

[ Two viewpoints ]
|lower social classes|higher social classes|
|---|---|
|Whitney|Tarde, Wundt|
|unculturedness, carelessness of lower classes|rapid speech, a sign of intelligence|

$p=31$

#### The curvilinear pattern

----
$widec$
(based on Labov research)
$/widec$
----

upper class
- very rarely the source of an innovation

lower class
- innovate, but these changes do not spread to the highest class

middle class
- where the magic happens

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

==curvilinear hypothesis==
- NO EXPLANATION !!!!

### Individual, group, community

$p=261$

## The Gender Paradox

$p=263$

### Gender differentiation of stable sociolinguistic variables in Philadelphia

$p=266$

### The general linguistic conformity of women

$widec$
_For stable sociolinguistic variables, women show a **lower rate of stigmatised variants**, and a **higher rate of prestige variants** than men._
$/widec$

$p=274$

$widec$
_In linguistic change from above, women adopt **prestige forms at a higher rate** than men._
$/widec$

#### Why?

**1.** power and status differential  
(Labov, Trudgill)
- "women have less economic power than men, and therefore rely more on $tt=the resources available to an individual on the basis of honor, prestige or recognition$symbolic capital$/tt$"
- => "reflection of socioeconomic weakness, and of a psychological as well as a sociological insecurity"
- (a lot of evidence for this)

$p=276$

**2.** linguistic skill  
(Chambers 1995)
- women have a wider range of style shifting as the product of their superior linguistic skills
- (hardly any evidence for this)

$p=277$

**3.** women as more accurate observers and reporters of their own speech
- (this is not the case)

$p=279$

### Gender differentiation of changes from below

#### The major tendency: women in advance

$p=292$

$widec$
_In linguistic change from below, women use higher frequencies of innovative forms than men do._
$/widec$

$p=290$

#### General explanations for the leadership of women

----
$widec$
Conservative and innovative behaviours of women -> how to marry the two ideas?
$/widec$
----

**1.** women's superior sensitivity to the social evaluation of language
- in stable situations, women perceive and react to prestige or stigma more strongly than men do
- when change begins, women are quicker and more forceful in employing the new social symbolism

**2.** verbal superiority of women
- little evidence

#### Juxtaposing the principles

$widec$
_**Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistic norms
that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they
are not.**_
$/widec$

$p=415$

## Transmission

### The transmission problem

$p=416$

$widec$
_Children must learn to talk differently from their mothers, and these differences must be in the same direction in each succeeding generation._
$/widec$

 $wide$
- $result the transmission problem -> vernacular re-organisation
$/wide$

$p=417$

### The transmission of stable sociolinguistic variables

simple transmission
- children reproduce parents' invariant pattern

$widec$
$contrast
$/widec$

*real* pattern
- children need to reproduce parent's pattern, which includes random unconditioned variation

$p=421$

### The transmission of change

#### Directional change

sound change independent of grammar
- transforms, as changes progress, into a trend

$widec$
- => how are such directional changes transmitted?
$/widec$

$p=422$

#### Proposals for change at first acquisition

----
$widec$
How can the process of language acquisition lead to language change?
$/widec$
----

**1.** adults
- possess a variable grammar that is not fully integrated

**2.** children
- learn the language, then simplify it with more efficient schemata
- => cf. Lightfoot 1997

$p=427$

#### The relationship between children and parents

### Directional language change among Philadelphia children

$p=432$

### Transmission among adolescents in Detroit

$p=446$

## Incrementation

incrementation
- near-linear, decade-by-decade advances
- how does this process work?

### Stabilisation
