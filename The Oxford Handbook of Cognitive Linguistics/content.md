## Introducing cognitive linguistics

$p=3$

### Introduction

cognitive linguistics
- language as an instrument for **organising, processing and conveying information**

perspective
- formal structures of language are **reflections of general conceptual organisation**, categorisation principles, processing mechanisms and experiential and environmental influences

$p=4$

### The theoretical position of cognitive linguistics

topics of special interest
- natural language categorisation
- functional principles of linguistic organisation
- conceptual interface between syntax and semantics
- experiential and pragmatic background of language-in-use
- relationship between language and thought

$p=5$

$reader$
**Definition**

Cognitive Linguistics is the study of language in its **cognitive function**, where *cognitive* refers to the crucial role of the **intermediate informational structures** in our encounters with the world.
$/reader$

view on language
- language as a repository of world knowledge
- => structured collection of meaningful categories that help us deal with new experiences, and store information about old ones

$widec$
Three fundamental characteristics
$/widec$
----

1. the primacy of semantics in linguistic analysis
	- the basic function of language involves **meaning**
	- if the primary function is language is categorisation, then **meaning must be the primary linguistic phenomenon**
2. the encyclopedic nature of linguistic meaning
	- no need for a separate level of knowledge of the world -> encoded in language
3. the perspectival nature of linguistic meaning
	- the world is not objectively reflected in language

## Embodiment and experientalism

### Introduction

----
$widec$
How does language work?
$/widec$
----

==**Objectivist** tradition==
- meaning is something **abstract**, propositional and symbolic
- semantics is purely referential, syntactic structures resolve to **logical relations**

$p=26$

==**Cognitive** tradition==
- utterances (and meaning) are embedded within a **cognitive and social situation**
- semantics beyond the purely referential, also for communication and shared experiences

$p=27$

### The senses of embodiment

embodiment
- "human physical, cognitive, and social embodiment ground our conceptual and linguistic systems"
- <-> generativist: language system as something detached and abstract (nvda.)

$p=48$

## Construal and perspectivisation

### Introduction

semantics in cognitive linguistics
- **cognitive** -> not simply a medium between language and the world (or truth conditions *about* the world)

$widec$
$down
$/widec$

==construal==
- term used for **different ways of viewing a particular situation**
- a feature of the meaning of all linguistic expressions

$p=49$

$reader$
A speaker who accurately observes the spatial distribution of certain stars can describe them in many distinct fashions: as a *constellation*, as a *cluster of stars* as *specks of lights in the sky*, etc. Such expressions are semantically distinct; **they reflect the speaker's alternate construals of the scene**, each compatible with its objectively given properties. (Langacker 1990a: 61)
$/reader$

$result many different ways of looking at the world
- depends on knowledge of the world, focus (collective stars, individual stars ...)

$p=63$

### Perspectivisation

perspectivisation
- having the relation between the ground and the object of conceptualisation profiled in the **interpretation of the utterances**
- e.g. *The ballroom is below.* -> grounding in the actual utterance itself

$p=82$

## Schematicity

### Introduction

$p=83$

### The nature of schematicity

#### The basic idea

_schema_
- a superordinate concept
- specifies the basic outline common to several, or many, more specific concepts

$result *elaborations* / *instantiations* / *subcases*
- fill in the schema or outline

#### Langacker's characterisation

ability to generalise
- ~= extraction of schemas
- "one of the most central human cognitive capabilities"
- ability to abstract less important details

$p=84$

hierarchy
- schemas can exist relative to each other
- i.e. organised with arrows ("->")

#### Lakoffian "Image Schemas"

image schemas
- "relatively simple structures that constantly recur in our **everyday bodily experience**"
- e.g. <span class="feature">containers</span>, <span class="feature">paths</span>, <span class="feature">links</span>, <span class="feature">up-down</span>, <span class="feature">front-back</span>, etc.

$p=85$

difference with Langacker's schemas
- Lakoff schemas are *central truths*, not many Langacker schemas will be Lakoffian schemas

### The ubiquity of schematicity

ubiquity of schematicity
- present in every langauge
- every language will have some concepts which are relatively specific, and others which are about the same but _less_ specific
