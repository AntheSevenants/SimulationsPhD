# Usage-based approaches to language change

$public=true$

## Introduction

formal linguistics (p. 1)
- studies linguistic system **in its own right**
- i.e. in isolation from its use in human interaction
- no relation with human cognition

usage-based models of language (p. 1)
- intimate relation between linguistic structure and usage
- not a homogeneous theory of language -> converging ideas within a larger functional/cognitive framework

### Original context of the notion 'usage-based'

beginning of term 'usage-based' (p. 2)
- Langacker (1987, p. 46)
- employed in a **descriptive** sense to distinguish his concept
of ‘Cognitive Grammar’ from ‘Generative Grammar

$reader$
In describing cognitive grammar as a “usage-based” model of language structure,
I have in mind the “maximalist”, “non-reductive”, and “bottom-up” character of
the general approach (as compared to the minimalist, reductive, and top-down
spirit of the generative tradition). (Langacker 1988, p. 131)
$/reader$

'bottom-up'? (p. 2)
- **usage data** are the basis for the mental representations
	- 'usage' = interaction between speaker and hearer

$widec$
$contrast
$/widec$

top-down (p. 2)
- representations originate in some **language faculty**
- i.e. a genetically determined module in the human brain

$reader$
Geeraerts & Cuyckens (2007, pp. 5–6) point out that there is another fundamental distinction between Cognitive Grammar and Generative Grammar. While the former sees **mental
representations of linguistic structures as representing _world_ structures and thus as knowledge about the world**, the latter views **mental representations as _an individual’s knowledge
about language alone_**. But this distinction, crucial though it is, does not concern us here.

**Key features of usage-based models**

- an intimate **relation** between linguistic **structures** and _**instances**_ of use of
language,
- the importance of **frequency**,
- **comprehension** and **production** as integral, rather than peripheral, to the linguistic system,
- focus on the role of **learning** and **experience** in language acquisition,
- linguistic representations as **emergent**, rather than as fixed entities,
- importance of **usage data** in theory construction and description,
- the intimate **relation** between **usage, synchronic variation and diachronic
change**,
- the **interconnectedness** of the **linguistic system with non-linguistic cognitive
systems**,
- the crucial role of **context** in the operation of the linguistic system.

Not all of these points are equally central for a usage-based understanding of
language. Some of them seem (nowadays) almost trivial, but **should be seen as a
response to the huge impact some Chomskyan presuppositions have had on linguistics**. In other words, had there not been very influential claims to their contrary from the generative tradition, it had not been as important to point them
out. For instance the **interconnectedness of language with other areas of cognition deserves mention because the Chomskyan project started off by claiming
not only the autonomy of the language faculty, but also a relative autonomy of
certain areas of linguistic description such as syntax and morphology**. Also, that
language data should be taken from usage is ultimately a response to the methodological assumption that the best access a linguist can get to language was the
speaker’s intuition. (p. 3)

### The interplay between usage and grammar

----
$widec$
How does usage affect structure?
$/widec$
----

'usage' (p. 4)
- the exchange of an utterance in the speaker-hearer interaction (= 'usage event')

mapping of structure and usage (p. 4)
- not flawless -> structure is open to variation (and change)

#### Types of innovation and change

new meanings out of old ones (p. 5)
- in each usage event, speaker and hearer engage in the negotiation of (new) meanings
- context can dictate a new interpretation -> new meaning **inferenced**
	- through repetition, these new interpretations can become conventional

$acco$
**1.** reshaping the denotation itself (p. 5)
- changes made to the **core meaning**
- i.e. through innovative use

**2.** pragmatic, social or psychological change (p. 5)
- innovative usage is triggered for instance by the mere wish to achieve the highest
possible attention for the point a speaker intends to make, by the attempt to achieve
a best possible basis for a potentially face threatening claim or simply the best possible self-image irrespective of the actual proposition

$example$
Formally, the simplest effects
of this behaviour are cases of ‘**reinforcement**’ – the speakers’ tendency to augment
highly frequent and therefore rather mundane expressions with additional material (e.g. _not at all_ vs. _not_). The socio-psychological motivation for this behaviour
is often labelled ‘**extravagance**’ or ‘**expressiveness**’ (see, e.g. Keller 1994, Section 4). Negotiating one’s social stance or simply exerting politeness strategies are instantiated by resorting to new unexpected ways of expressing things. (p. 5)
$/example$

$acco$
**3.** analogy (p. 5-6)
- a construed **correspondence** between a **known pattern** and
**some element that is to be categorised or fit into a new instantiation of that pattern**
- given pattern serves as a model for a new structure
- e.g. metaphorical extensions of lexical meaning

$info$
Acknowledging the role of analogy in language change is of course a major
endorsement of the cognitivist position. **These types of transfer from a known
structure onto a new pattern cannot be accounted for without cognitive activity on
part of the individual speaker** – in the form of analogical inferences during online
mental processing. At the same time, a necessary precondition of such an analogical transfer is that **there is some novel aspect in each usage event** for which a
known pattern is being employed. (p. 6)

**4.** frequency effects (p. 7)
- higher frequency allows for the **phonetic reduction** of a form
- higher frequency endorses a form's **entrenchment** in the linguistic system
- <-> low frequency: necessitates clear articulation, form can sometimes even get lost

$info$
According to the cognitivist position, the repetition of such usage events
may also give rise to changes in the linguistic structure because the repeated
co-occurrence of a string of elements for instance leads to the establishment of
neuromotor routines that facilitate their production. These routines do not only
lead to an increasing reduction of phonological substance in usage but will ultimately affect the mental representation of these elements as one unit (cf. Bybee &
Scheibman 1999; Bybee & Thompson 2000; Bybee 2010). (p. 7)
$/info$

$result frequency? (p. 7)
- frequency **per context** (not *absolute* frequency)
-  reduction of an expression, in the sense of a
string of articulation units (phonemes), is possible if (and only if) it can be expected **in a specific situation**

$example$
For instance, the phonetic string of the German expression _wiedersehen_ ‘see again’, can be
(and is) reduced drastically if (and only if) this string is used in the highly conventionalised
formula for saying ‘goodbye’ (_Auf Wiedersehen_ ‘on seeing (each other) again’). Reductions can
go as far as a bisyllabic /'vɪǝzen/ for a four-syllabic /'viːdɐzeǝn/. This is not possible if the string
is uttered in a situation, in which the interlocutors do not part, even if it specifically refers to
the formulaic ‘farewell’ rather than to the lexical ‘see again’, as for instance in reported speech. (p. 7)
$/example$

$info$
An **increase in frequency** automatically also results in the **increase of the degree of _conventionality_** of an expression or construction. The more often a linguistic form occurs, the more routinely
it is processed in both production and perception and hence the more likely it is
re-used by an individual speaker. (p. 8)

$info$
What all these phenomena or aspects of language change share
is their context-dependence. In principle, they all require the uniqueness of each
individual context or speech situation (usage event). If the specific circumstance
of an individual usage event did not play any role, there would be no need for
innovation. (p. 8)
$/info$

### From a cognition-centred to a communication-centred usage-based perspective

usage-based model of language (p. 9)
- grammar is based on **usage** but located and processed in the **human
mind**
- => **cognitive** approach

'individuality' of language (p. 9)
- innovative language use happens in the *speaker*
- however: some system needs to be **shared** -> otherwise, successful communication is impossible
- => language as a social-communicative activity

$reader$
**Social cues**

a pragmatically-oriented cognitive linguistics needs to recognize three different
but intimately connected objects of description:  

1. the flow of **usage is the basic
level**, but in addition there is 
2. language as a property of the **speech community**
[…], and finally 
3.  language as a **property of individual speakers** (that which
qualifies them to be members of the speech community)

(Harder 2012, p. 519)

$result “the individual level just
does not capture all there is to say” (Harder 2010, p. 6)

social aspect (p. 10)
- *Emergent Grammar* (Hopper 1987), _Invisible Hand_ (Keller 1994)
-  show
how linguistic structures are formed (“emerge”) _through_ communication according to the patterns of social systems

complex-adaptive system (p. 11)
- "language is in principle dynamic rather
than static"
- "synchronic stages are random snapshots of what is a constantly (re-)emerging system"

usage-based approach: summary
- the **circumstances** and **input of the speaker-hearer interaction** need to be taken into account in an analysis of linguistic structures
- this makes a cognitivist position plausible
