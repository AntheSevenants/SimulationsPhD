# Experimenting on the past: a case study on changing analysability in English ly-adverbs

$public=true$

$reader$
**Abstract**

While it is undoubtedly true that historical data do not lend themselves well to the
reproduction of experimental findings, the availability of increasingly extensive data
sets has brought some experimenting within practical reach. This means that certain
predictions based on a combination of synchronic observations and uniformitarian
thinking are now testable. **Synchronic evidence shows a negative correlation between
analysability in morphologically complex words and various measures of frequency**.
It is therefore expected that **when the frequency of morphologically complex items
changes, their analysability will change along with this**. **If analysability decreases, this
should in turn be reflected in decreasing sensitivity to priming by items with analogous
composition**. The latter prediction is in principle testable on diachronic data, offering
a way of verifying the diachronic effect of frequency change on analysability. In this
spirit, **the present article examines the relation between changing frequency and priming
sensitivity, as a proxy to analysability**. This is done for a sample of 250 English _ly_-adverbs,
such as roughly, blindly, publicly, etc. over the period 1950–2005, using data from the
Hansard Corpus. **Some of the expected relations between frequency and analysability can
be shown to hold, albeit with great variation across lexical items**. At the same time, **much
of the variation in our measure of analysability cannot be accounted for by frequency or
frequency change alone**.

## Uniformitarianism

uniformitarianism (p. 317)
- allows us to explain the past in terms of what we know about
the present
- generally accepted in linguistics as a useful principle, related to the more general
principle known as Ockham’s razor (see Janda & Joseph 2003: 25), it has obvious
limitations in this field as well (see also Bergs 2012)

The task of the historical linguist is to explain
the differences between the past and the present; but to the extent that the past was
different from the present, there is no way of knowing how different it was’ (Labov
2001a: 21).

If historical disciplines are more
preoccupied with this uncertainty, it is perhaps because falsification tends to be more
difficult. (p. 318)

## Degrees of structure

$reader$
Findings like these support the idea that **structure is gradient, in that some complex
words are more readily decomposable into base and affix than others** – a property
we will refer to here as ‘**analysability**’. Analysability refers to **the degree to which
language users can recognize the individual parts of a composite whole** (Langacker
1987: 448; Bybee 2010: 45). Analysability is **closely related to compositionality,
which refers to the degree to which the properties of a composite whole are
predictable from the properties of its parts** (Langacker 1987: 448; Bybee 2010: 45).
Analysability is the broader term, however, in that an expression may decrease in
analysability without losing compositionality, but not vice versa. In addition, while an
expression’s compositionality is a function of its semantic and formal characteristics,
its analysability is an underlying property that is not directly accessible to the observer. (p. 319)

Importantly, both Hay (2003) and Gonnerman et al. (2007) are able to make
predictions as to which words are likely to be more analysable. Hay (2003) argues that
**phonotactics and the relative frequency of base and derivation play a role**. For instance, _government_ is less analysable than _settlement_ because the derived form _government_ is
more frequent than its base _govern_, while the derived form _settlement_ is less frequent
than its base _settle_. Gonnerman et al. (2007) show that other important determinants
are the degree of semantic and formal similarity between a base and the corresponding
free form. For instance, _lately_ is less compositional – and hence less analysable – than
_boldly_ because the semantic contribution of _late_ to _lately_ is less predictable than that
of _bold_ to _boldly_. (p. 320)

Gradience also crops up in historical linguistics. One challenge is presented
by grammaticalization processes (Traugott & Trousdale 2010). For instance,
grammaticalization is often accompanied by formal reduction. This may result in
a formal continuum between the reduced form and the original full form. Krug
(2000: 152), for instance, cites the forms [ˈwɒntˌtʰuː], [ˈwɒntˌtʊ], [ˈwɒntʊ], [ˈwɒntə],
[ˈwɒnə], [ˈwənə], [wɒn] and [wɑ͂ ] as potential realizations of English _want to_. (p. 320)

Traditionally, underlying syntactic change
has been seen as abrupt (e.g. Harris 2003). However, there are dissenting views. One
line of reasoning links grammaticalization to structural gradience through frequency
(Haspelmath 1999; Bybee 2003, 2006, 2010). **Grammaticalizing forms become more
frequent. This makes it more likely that they are stored autonomously. As a result,
they become dissociated from their component parts.** This licenses semantic and
formal change, which in turn contributes to the dissociation between the whole and
its parts. **The gradient, then, is fundamentally one of analysability.** (p. 320)

In diachrony, it is much harder to test the idea of gradually changing analysability.
But there may be a way out. In a study reminiscent of the priming experiments by
Gonnerman et al. (2007), Torres **Cacoullos (2015) uses written historical data to show
that the Spanish progressive construction, consisting of _estar_ and a gerund, appeared to
be initially primed by any other use of the verb _estar_, but the priming relation became
weaker with time as the construction grammaticalized**. Torres Cacoullos explicitly
invokes ‘priming effects as a measure of (erosion of) analyzability’ (2015: 266). (p. 321)

we address changes in the degree of analysability of English _ly_-adverbs.
These are adverbs formed from adjectives by the addition of the suffix _ly_, such as
_cheaply_, _categorically_, _specially_ or _morally_. **It is expected that _ly_-adverbs may vary
in analysability – i.e. the degree to which _ly_-adverbs are recognized as consisting
of an adjectival base and the _ly_-suffix.** Further, it is expected that **analysability may
change over time, subject to frequency changes,** whether they are changes in the token
frequency of an individual adverb (cf. Gordon & Alegre 1999; Bybee 2006) or in
the relation between the frequency of the adverb and that of its base (see Hay 2003;
Blumenthal-Dormé 2012). (p. 321)

A form whose underlying structure is less analysable will be less likely to
prime or to be primed by other forms with a similar structure. **We assume that priming
effects hold between a prime and a target if the occurrence of the prime positively
affects the likelihood of subsequent occurrence of the target**. (p. 321)

Our study differs from that by Torres Cacoullos in two important ways, both having
to do with the choice of case study. First, our case study should allow us better to isolate
structural priming effects (Bock 1987). We can take the more abstract derivational
template [Adjective + ly] as prime and see how its occurrence affects the likelihood of
occurrence for any specific ly-adverb. This way, the magnitude of the observed priming
effects primarily reflects a structural property of the ly-adverb in question. Second,
the effect of underlying structural change can be tested on a much larger number of
individual cases – in principle, any ly-adverb that occurs in more than one subperiod of
the corpus. This potential for systematic replication should make findings much more
reliable. We should avoid being misled by a lucky find, and we should also get some
idea of the overall magnitude of the effects we are interested in. (p. 322)

## Measuring priming effects in corpus data

$reader$
There are two potentially relevant measures. 

First, **the more analysable a specific
ly-adverb is, the more sensitive it will be to priming by other ly-adverbs**. We call this
relation **‘passive priming’** because the adverb in question is being **structurally primed**.
In corpus data passive priming will translate into a **tendency for the adverb to occur in
the vicinity of other ly-adverbs that occurred earlier in the discourse and functioned as
prime**. In other words, the context immediately preceding our adverb will tend to have
slightly more _ly_-adverbs than one would normally expect. (p. 322)

Second, it can be expected
that **a highly analysable ly-adverb will be more capable of structurally priming other
ly-adverbs**. This is **‘active priming’** because **the adverb in question structurally primes
other adverbs**. In corpus data active priming should translate as a slightly higher than expected incidence of ly-adverbs immediately following the priming adverb. (p. 320-321)
