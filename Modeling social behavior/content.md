$reader$
The social sciences do not have a solid, broadly agreed-upon theoretical foundation in the same way that the physical sciences and even some of the biological sciences do. This is partly because the social sciences are younger, and partly because they deal with **extremely complex systems that can be described at multiple levels of organization**.
